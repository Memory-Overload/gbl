# Luz Embraces Her Inner Horse Girl

**Schlaftag 1, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl House**

Luz opened the door to the Owl House, revealing Eda and King on the couch. The two of them were both wearing ear protection, with Eda having removed her hands and stuck them in her ears, while King had pillows strapped to his skull. In Eda’s arms, she softly cradled the bat baby creature thing as best she could without hands, gently rocking it back and forth. King, meanwhile, was curled up and relaxing comfortably on the arm of the couch, using the pillows both as ear muffs and actual pillows.

“Hey, guys.” Luz said, making her presence known. “Got your books returned, Eda.”

“Thanks for doing that, kid. We’ve still got our hands full, as you can see,” Eda said, still rocking the baby.

“Well, I’ll have you know that you look very motherly,” Luz replied.

“Call me that word again and I take away your bed.” Eda glared at the basilisk to drive home the threat.

“What? How could you say that around this little cutie patootie?” Luz walked over and gave the baby a scratch on the tummy.

“No, don’t do that\!” Eda warned, but it was too late. As if reflexively, the baby awoke from its nap and proceeded to vomit out a duplicate of itself, and the duplicate in turn barfed out another clone. Now with three baby bat demons, the triplets began crying after being rudely awoken and/or brought into existence, their wails assaulting Luz’s eardrums.

“I knew babies could be loud, but this seems like a bit much,” Luz said, covering her ears with her hands.

The babies flew all around the living room, trashing everything that wasn’t nailed down to the floor. Potions were thrown willy-nilly, and Luz was pretty sure that one of them was now wearing a pair of Eda’s boots.

Wait, Luz could shapsehift. That means she didn’t have to have ears\!

While it was a little weird feeling her ears disappear (and a little bit painful), the incessant crying from the babies did eventually give way to a peaceful silence. Except now she couldn’t hear anything, including Eda trying to talk to hear. She could see the Owl Lady’s lips moving, but she had no idea what the witch was saying.

“I can’t hear you,” Luz said, pointing to where her right ear used to be. She hoped she said it loud enough for the others to hear, but it could have been as quiet as a whisper for all she knew.

Eda got the message, though. She thought for a moment before pointing to the kitchen. She then mimed biting into something spherical, and then mimed cutting something.

“Do you want me to get an apple and a knife?” Luz asked. Eda nodded in confirmation.

Running into the kitchen, Luz quickly grabbed an apple from the fruit bowl on the counter, a large knife from the collection on the wall, and a cutting board from below the stove top.

Luz returned to the living room and handed the items to Eda, who promptly propped her ankle up on her her knee and laid the cutting board down on the makeshift table. Popping her hands back into place, Eda placed the apple on the cutting board and steadied it. Once everything was settled, Eda began to cut the apple into thin slices.

The second the knife made contact with the apple, the babies immediately stopped causing a ruckus, flying down from the ceiling to sit in a row in front of Eda, patiently waiting for their treat.

Now that the coast was clear, Luz morphed her ears back into existence. The sounds of the world rushed back to her. The slight creaking of the floorboards. The occasional breathing within the walls that Luz still didn’t know the cause of. The random screaming outside. It all returned. As Luz got her bearings, she heard Eda say something, but she wasn’t sure what.

“Sorry, could you repeat that?” Luz asked.

“I said, ‘Thanks,’” Eda replied.

As Eda was giving Baby \#2 its third slice, her scroll buzzed. Retrieving it from her pocket, Eda looked at the notification before handing it to Luz.

**Conversation with: WitchChick128**

---

WitchChick128: Hello, Ms. Clawthorne. I need to talk with Luz, and since she doesn't have a scroll, I figured you would be the second best option. Could you let me talk to her?

BADGIRLCOVEN: yo this is Luz

BADGIRLCOVEN: whats up

WitchChick128: Ed and Em just snuck out of the manor, and they were talking about the Wailing Star.

WitchChick128: I'm pretty sure they headed in the direction of the library.

BADGIRLCOVEN: and you need me for what? backup in case things go south?

WitchChick128: Yes. Can you get to the library quickly?

BADGIRLCOVEN: yeah, especially if I morph something fast

WitchChick128: Great\! Thank you, Luz.

BADGIRLCOVEN: no prob :)

Handing Eda her scroll back, Luz explained the situation. “I’ve got to head to the library. Amity needs backup for fending off Ed and Em’s pranks. Or something like that. Anyways, I gotta go. Byeee\!”

With that parting, Luz ran out the front door of the Owl House. She needed something fast, and nothing was more apt for this situation than a horse. While cheetahs were faster, they could only keep that speed up for a short distance, and the library was a few miles away, so she needed consistent high speed, and that was what the horse offered.

As Luz pictured the morph, she felt a stabbing pain as her fingers and toes melded together to become hooves of thick keratin. Pushing through the pain, her a wave of brown fur began spreading across her body, emanating from her wrists before going down to her ankles. Sensing that she was about to fall forward, Luz got on all fours before she was forced to by gravity. As the morph continued, she felt her nose elongate and shift into a snout, jutting out in front of her. Her mouth had been dragged along for the ride, as well. However, her eyes decided to shift towards the side of her head,making it harder to concentrate on her giant snout. Finally, a tail sprouted behind her, topped off with a thick tuft of fur.

With the morph complete, Luz cautiously took her first few steps in her new body. She quickly developed a strategy. Left hind leg forward. Then right hind leg. Then left foreleg. Then right foreleg. Repeat until you get to where you need to go.

As she got more used to the odd movements, Luz gradually picked up speed until she was going at full blast. The wind that she could barely feel before now flowed through her mane, whipping it around behind her like she was in one of those commercials for a super expensive perfume.

As her hooves pounded against the cobblestone, Luz weaved around the witches and demons walking the streets. She passed by shopkeepers of the Night Market, citizens out for walks, and she was pretty sure she galloped past a group of kids who were undoubtedly breaking curfew. As she ran by, most stopped to turn and stare at her. To them, some foreign beast had just emerged from nowhere and was streaking down the main road at an incredibly fast speed.

In what felt like no time at all, Luz stood before the entrance to the library. Amity was waiting at the top of the steps, looking around for her backup.

Sensing an opportunity, Luz trotted over to the young Blight and neighed to get the witch’s attention.

“Hey, Luz,” Amity said, before pausing. “Wait, you are Luz, right? I’m not just talking to some random creature?”

Luz let out an offended snort. Who else could rock a mane like this? She tossed her head back, letting it fall gracefully onto her back.

She quickly morphed back into her Luz-but-with-Witch-ears form, once again noticing the sharp pain that accompanied it. The potion from earlier must have worn off, she surmised.

“Really, Amity? Do you think anyone else could look so stylish while being a horse? I’m appalled, honestly,” Luz said sarcastically.

Amity chuckled. “No, I guess not.”

“Alright, then what’s the plan?” Luz said, puttting on a serious face.

“Oh… um…” Amity stalled and grew flustered, not ready for the question. “I guess go in there and fix whatever Ed and Em have broken.”

Luz smiled at the girl. “Good plan\! Let’s go\!”

Without waiting, Luz loosed a battle cry and charged at the door, throwing a leaping kick at it. The door offered no resistance whatsoever, and Luz practically sailed into the library before crashing down onto the floor, letting out an *OOF* as the wind was knocked out of her. That drew a loud laugh from Amity, who cautiously stepped through the now open door and offered the embarrassed Luz a hand up, which was accepted.

Making their way through the main foyer, which seemed relatively unchanged, the two entered the main hall of the library, which looked… different, to say the least.

“Yup, Ed and Em have been through here,” Amity concluded.

To their left, a veritable mountain of snow covered numerous bookshelves, complete with a few small snowmen placed at the base. On the right, a mix of froufrou dresses and tuxedos and Dragon Claw Z-esque jumpsuits were strewn about on the floor. Above them, birds that Luz thought to be extinct circled her head, occasionally screeching.

There was one constant amongst all this chaos, though: books. Wherever there was something weird, an open book would be nearby.

“Hmm… I wonder…” Luz thought aloud. She walked over to one of the books that was close to an expensive-looking dress. She closed the book, and the dressed poofed out of existence, as if it was never there in the first place. Walking over to another book, she closed it, leading to the Dragon Claw Z getup vanishing in a similar manner to the dress.

On the other side of the library, Amity had made the same discovery, with the mountains of snow disappearing before Luz’s eyes as Amity closed both *Snowballs, a History* and *Winter for Dummies*.

Suddenly, the sound of distressed quacking pierced through the relative silence, which was soon followed by a pair laughing. Luz and Amity sprinted towards the source of the troubled duck, only to find that the twins were long gone by the time they arrived. The only evidence was *Quacks Wants Snacks* laying atop a bookshelf.

Amity opened the book, and Quacks appeared, though the duck had a horrifyingly human pair of legs. Quacks began screaming again, so Luz tried to calm it down by softly stroking its fur. As Amity investigated the book, she saw that Quacks normal legs had been drawn over with a pencil, leading to its odd appearance. Amity quickly closed the book to stop Quacks’ suffering.

“The poor little guy had no idea what was going on,” Luz lamented.

“We’ve got to make Ed and Em come to their senses before they get themselves hurt,” Amity said.

“At least they weren’t being sneaky,” Luz replied, pointing towards the books that had been scattered on the floor, creating a trail the two could follow.

After following the path of books (and puttting them back in their rightful spot), Luz and Amity had reached an apparent dead end at the Romance section. Luz looked around to see if there were any other books that could indicate where the twins had gone, but her searching was fruitless.

After watching the other girl putter about, Amity let out a sigh.

“I think I know where they are,” she said quietly. She then reached up and pulled down *The Lone Witch and the Secret Room*. A bookshelf in front of Luz slowly moved to the side revealing Amity’s hidden study, and inside that study stood Edric and Emira Blight.

The twins were busy looking through all the books in their sister’s private room, with a large pile gathered on the desk.

“Hey Mittens, glad you could join us,” Edric said, as if this was nothing out of the ordinary.

“What are you – Why – How did you even get in here?” Amity forced out.

“We’re searching for your diary so we can post the pages all over Penstagram. Why? Payback for you tattling about us cutting class. How? We pulled the book down, just like you did. You should also probably chose a more inconspicuous book, by the way. That one’s too easy to figure out,” Emira calmly explained as she dumped another book on the pile.

“Get. Out,” Amity growled.

“What? But we haven’t even found your diary yet\!” Ed complained.

“I said GET OUT\!” his younger sister yelled, pointing towards the door.

“Ugh. Have it your way, Mittens. We’ll get out of your hair,” Em said, throwing one last book onto the pile before leaving.

“Yeah, we were just having fun. Way to kill the vibe, Mittens,” Ed added as he joined his twin.

The twins forced there way past Amity and began walking away. Amity immediately began putting the books back in their shelves, but Luz trailed after the twins.

“Hey\!” she shouted.

Ed groaned and turned to face her, with Emira following suit. “Ugh, what do you want?”

“Don’t think I didn’t see how you guys treated Amity back there. That’s not how a family is supposed to act,” Luz said.

“Really, because that’s just how us Blights show tough love,” Em responded.

“’Tough love’? That’s bat guano and you know it. Family members are supposed to love and care for each other, not leak a person’s private journal for everyone to see.”

“Look, kid. As Blights, we have a reputation to uphold. If we don’t, then Mom gets royally pissy, and you don’t like her when she’s pissy. That’s why we had to get back at Amity. She was making us, and by extension our whole family, look bad. Now we can’t let that happen, can we?” Ed explained.

“I’m just saying, have you guys considered standing up to your mom?” Luz asked.

“Oh we’ve tried plenty of times, but nothing gets through to her,” Em said.

“Well, can you at least be nicer to Amity?” Luz tried again.

The twins paused. “We’ll think on that,” they said in unison. With that, the two left the library having made it to the foyer.

Luz quickly made her way back to Amity’s secret hideout. The emerald-haired witch had already gotten a majority of the books back in place, so Luz took the time to check out the witch’s personal collection.

A strikingly familiar book spine caught her attention.

“No way\! You have the Good Witch Azura books\!?” Luz didn’t even know that they existed in this realm. Well, except for the copies she had brought over, but still\!

“Oh, you’ve heard of them?” Amity asked, surprised by the other girl’s excitement.

“Have I heard of them? I only have every book in the series, 1-5 in both regular and Collector’s Edition versions,” Luz bragged.

“Wait, there’s a fifth one? I didn’t know that.” Amity guessed that the she bought her collection from store (which had just gotten a new manager, for some reason) hadn’t picked up the rights to sell the book yet, but Luz had a copy somehow.

“Do you wanna have mine?” Luz said, rifling around in her backpack. After a few seconds of searching, she pulled out *The* *Good Witch Azura: Fall of Zargothrax* and offered it out to Amity.

Amity took the book and examined the front and back cover. Something looked just a little bit off, but she couldn’t quite place her finger on what exactly.

“Thank you. So when will you want this back?” she asked.

“You can keep it. I can’t let you have an incomplete set of the greatest fiction series ever written,” Luz answered.

“Oh. Thank you.”

“No problem. I hope you like it as much as I did.”

As Luz walked back from the library, she took a deep breath, enjoying the crisp chill air. Today had been a good day. She still needed to retake that potion from before. Being able to shapeshift without feeling ike she had just been stabbed was nice. She looked up at the moon. To think that a rock floating in space could have such a lasting impact was incredible, but also incredibly annoying.

Now that she thought about it, she had done some pretty big morphs today, and she was feeling pretty hungry. It wasn’t a hunger for food, though. Luz ignored the hunger and kept walking.

Just as she was about to cross the property line of The Owl House, Luz collapsed.
