# Willow Plays Matchmaker

**Kaufetag 1, Seventh Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Blight Manor**

A knock at the door drew Odalia’s attention. Letting out a groan of annoyance, she signaled for one of the Abomaton prototypes to go answer the door. As the construct marched over to fulfill its task, Odalia wondered what dullard thought it was a smart idea to intrude upon her property. Perhaps it was some prospective business partner or investor? Though showing up at such a late hour was queer. As the Abomaton slowly pulled the door open, Odalia was shocked to see Half-a-Witch standing in her doorway.

“I’m here to see Amity,” Half-a-Witch said bluntly, not looking Odalia in the face, her eyes trained on something off in the distance.

“And why should I allow that?” Odalia inquired, placing a hand on her hip and letting out a snort.

“Because she’s my friend,” Half-a-Witch answered, sticking her hands behind her back.

Odalia scoffed. “You expect me to actually believe that? That’s an excellent joke, little Half-a-Witch. You should work on the delivery, though. You almost sound like you really mean what you say. But, to answer your question: no, Amity will not see you.”

Half-a-Witch paused. “I don’t know if Amity’s told you, but I’m not even on the Abomination track anymore. Principal Bump switched me over to the Plant track after I showed him how skilled I am in it.”

“Wow, that must be so challenging, going from something you have no skill in whatsoever to something you’re slightly passable at. Even if you’re going from something as renowned as abominations to… plant magic, congratulations are in order\! I’ll throw a bash to celebrate. It will be a momentous day – Wait… wait, I just remembered something,” Odalia mocked. “I don’t care about you. Goodbye, Half-a-Witch”

Half-a-Witch sighed and slowly walked towards the door. “Right, fine. I’ll leave.”

The plant witch then slowly turned around and waited. “You know what, Mrs. Blight?”

“That doesn’t sound like the door closing behind you, so speak quickly before I have an Abomaton force you out of my house,” Odalia said.

“I don’t care about you, either.” Willow then sprinted past Odalia.

Odalia reached out to grab the insolent child as Willow ran past, but she tripped and fell, her legs suddenly encased in thick, thorn-ridden vines.

“Damn it,” Odalia hissed. She looked at one of the Abomaton prototypes that was just milling about in the kitchen. “Are you going to free me?”

The Abomaton prototype didn’t respond.

Odalia grumbled as she feebly tried to escape. Maybe the Park child wasn’t “Half-a-Witch” after all.

Willow gently rapped on Amity’s bedroom door.

“I already told you, Ed. I’m not interested in… Willow?” Amity was caught off guard as she opened her door.

“You and I need to talk,” Willow replied.

“About… what?” Amity replied slowly, blocking off the doorway with her body.

“Grom,” Willow said succinctly.

“That still doesn’t help me out. What about Grom, specifically?” Amity inquired, raising an eyebrow.

“About you and Luz going together,” Willow responded.

Amity slammed her eyes shut and exhaled sharply through clenched teeth. After a few seconds of deliberation, she stepped aside and allowed Willow to enter her room. “Fine, come in.”

“I remember what you said back in that memory on the Knee.” Willow said.

“Dang, I thought you would have forgotten about that,” Amity said, slumping against her bed. “So you still remember how I’m some weirdo.”

“Why would you be a weirdo?” Willow asked.

“Because I like Luz?” Amity said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.

“I’m serious, Amity.” Willow grabbed the chair from Amity’s desk and flipped it around before taking a seat and facing the abomination witch. “Luz likes you. And not in the friend way, in the ‘I want you to be my girlfriend’ way.”

The plant witch paused to take a breath before continuing. “Look, the way I see it, you have two options. You can either let Grom come and go whilst you just sit on your hands never letting Luz know how you feel and be stuck in this weird relationship limbo, or you can just suck it up and ask her out to the dance. Luz likes you, Amity. She really, truly does.”

“How are you so sure?” Amity asked cautiously, readjusting herself to sit more upright.

Willow let out a small laugh, somewhat in disbelief that Amity was still fighting her on this. “Do you remember how Luz was acting when her brain got torched and she saw you? She was full on flirting, Blight. ‘The only thing burning more than my memories is my heart?’ I’m pretty sure that can only be interpreted as flirting.”

Amity groaned, finally giving in. “Fine, so I like Luz, and she might – might\! – like me. Even if I did ask her out to Grom, how would I know if she’ll like my Gromposal? Ed and Em say that’s the most important part. If you mess up your Gromposal, you get ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of your life\!”

Willow snorted. “This is Luz we’re talking about here, Amity. I don’t think there’s anything that you could do to not make Luz like your Gromposal. Besides, who gives a hoot about what other people think about your Gromposal?”

Amity let out a deep exhale. “Right.” She reached over and grabbed a notepad and quill from her desk. Dipping the quill in the ink pot, she tapped off the excess before flipping the notepad to a blank page and writing “GROMPOSAL IDEAS” at the top in thick letters.

Suddenly, Willow rose from her seat. “And my work here is done. Good luck, Blight.”

That caught Amity by surprise. “What? You’re just gonna leave? I thought you were gonna help me come up with a Luz-worthy Gromposal.”

“And I am,” Willow replied. “If you want your Gromposal to be ‘Luz-worthy’, as you put it, then it has to be something entirely of your own. It can be a simple card, or it can be a grand spectacle with dancers and a marching band, whatever you can come up with. What matters, though, is that the idea is entirely from your brain and no one else's. Now, if you’ll excuse me, my dads are probably wondering where I am, so I need to head back home. Good luck, Amity.”

---

Amity groaned as she crumpled up yet another sheet of paper. Tossing it to the floor, it joined the dozens of other attempts that she had drafted up. How was she going to ask Luz out to Grom? Willow had said that the Gromposal had to be “entirely from her own brain”, but that wasn’t much help when the only thing going through her brain was how impossible this was.

The first question Amity had was what kind of Gromposal it should be. She wanted the Gromposal to be simple and straightforward. Nothing flashy or over the top, thank you very much. After some deliberation that had lasted all of 10 seconds, she had decided that a small handwritten note asking Luz out would fit the bill just fine. It was small, discreet, and if Luz rejected her then could easily destroy the evidence by setting it on fire.

Though, the last time she had set something on fire, she’d had to go into Luz’s brain and fix everything, and she did not want to repeat that. Okay, maybe setting it on fire wasn’t the best plan. She could just throw it away, yeah that’d work. Though someone could go snooping in the trash…

“Hey, Mittens,” Emira stuck her head into her younger sister’s room. “What are ya working on?”

Amity yelped in surprise at the sudden disturbance. When she realized it was just her sister, though, she calmed down. Slumping over her desk, she banged her forehead against the wood. “I’ve been trying to come up with a good Gromposal.”

“You’re coming up with a Gromposal? Wow, and I thought you just had a cold rock instead of a heart,” Em joked.

“Shut up,” Amity responded in a similar tone.

Em fully entered the room and stood by her sister so that she was hovering over Amity’s shoulder. “So, who's got your heart aflutter, Mittens? Some cute gal caught your eye and you just can’t stop thinking about her? Every time you see her, your breath catches in your throat and you have to remind yourself to breathe because dying doesn’t look cool in front of your crush? Who is it?”

Amity blushed and covered her face with her hands. “It’s…” she started, but she couldn’t work up the courage to say it aloud. “Just look for yourself.” To emphasize her point, she batted one of the crumpled balls of parchment with her foot, sending it in Em’s direction.

Emira bent over and picked up the ball of parchment. Unraveling it, she saw that it consisted of Amity inviting Luz to be her date to Grom. She could barely believe what she was reading. “Holy Titan, you have a crush on Luz?\!”

Amity shot up from her seat and covered Em’s mouth with her hand. “Say it louder, why don’t you? Do you want everyone on the Isles to know as well?” she hissed.

Emira simply licked Amity’s hand in response, causing the emerald-haired witch to pull back. “Ewww. Dang it, Emira, this isn’t a joke\!”

“You know,” Emira started, crossing her arms over her chest. “I could be running around the house screaming about how you have a crush on Luz, but I’m not that childish. That’s Ed’s schtick. But seriously: Luz? The same Luz that you’ve been avoiding for like the past few days?”

“Yes,” Amity said quietly, looking down at the floor and avoiding eye contact with her older sister.

“You see the problem here, right?” Emira asked after a few seconds of silence.

Amity raised her head. “Uh… no?”

“If you want to ask Luz out, that’s going to require you to, ya know, *talk with her*, right?” Emira probed.

The younger witch sighed. “I know. I just… I just don’t know how to do it.”

Emira propped her head up on her fist. “What do you mean? Does this have something to do with whatever’s been eating at ya recently?”

Amity exhaled slowly. “I guess you could say that.” She shifted in her chair as she thought of how to explain what all had happened without sounding like she was crazy. “Do you remember when we went on that trip to the Knee with Eda and Luz?”

Em nodded. “Yeah. That was when the Owl Lady helped you get a handle on a fire spell before you tested it on that slitherbeast. Wait… is that when you figured out you had a crush on Luz? Was it because Luz did that magic sucking thing and KO’d the slitherbeast to save the damsel in distress?”

“Shut up,” Amity said lightheartedly, giving Em a playful punch on the shoulder. “But, yeah, that was when I realized I liked her.”

“So what does that have to do with you avoiding Luz recently?” Emira inquired. “I don’t see the connection between you realizing you like her and now avoiding her like she’s got the mold.”

Amity sucked in a breath. “Well, I might have kinda accidentally, kinda on purpose burned up a ton of Luz’s memories while I was trying to destroy that particular memory. But then Ms. Eda sent me and Willow and Gus into Luz’s brain to fix it all up, and I think she’s okay now.”

Em scoffed. “No way\!” She gave a small laugh. “Titan, that’s a twist. No wonder you’ve been avoiding her.”

Amity slumped. “Yeah, I doubt she’d even want to talk to me though.”

“I wouldn’t be so sure about that,” Emira said with a smile. “Gus tends to blabbermouth when he’s bored in class, and one of his favorite topics is about how Luz is always wondering why you’re never around to hang out. From how Gus talks about her, I don’t think the kid has a single grudge-holding bone in her body. She cares about you, Mittens. You get that, yeah?”

The emerald-haired witch gave a small nod. “Yeah. So you think I actually have a chance of Luz saying yes?”

Em leaned back and folded her hands behind her head. “You’ll definitely have a better chance than Ed. He might not look it, but he’s been a nervous wreck trying to work up the courage to ask Jerbo out to Grom. If you actually ask Luz out, regardless of what she says, then you can rest easy knowing you're doing better than our dork supreme of a brother.”

Amity smiled and laughed. “Thanks, Em. And I mean that, really.”

“I’m your older sister. Being a fount of knowledge and relationship advice is kinda part of the job description. Well, that and annoying you.” Emira smirked at that last part. “Right, well, have fun writing the same note over and over again. You’ll get it eventually.”

Amity simply stuck her tongue out and blew a raspberry.

Emira just rolled her eyes as she headed for the door. When she was about to shut it, though, she stopped. “By the way, do you have any idea why Odalia has like a billion vines wrapped around her in the kitchen?”

It took Amity a few seconds to respond as her mind put together the pieces. “Ohhhhh… That’s how Willow got up here.”

Em nodded. “Ah, should have guessed that was the work of one of your pals. You know, I would go help out Mother dearest, but I just remembered that I have something in my room that will distract me for a long, long time and that means I won’t be able to hear Odalia’s shouts. It’s such a shame, really.”

Amity giggled. “Titan, don’t let mom hear you talk about that. Or actually do, I want to see her reaction.”

---

With part one of her plan done, Willow made the trek back to the Park house. Slipping in through the back door, she flicked on the light to the kitchen. She wasn’t alone, though.

Seated at the kitchen table, Gilbert Park was nursing a mug of bitterbean brew. “Don't worry, Flower,” Willow’s father said. “I’ll keep your little rendezvous with the Blight girl a secret.”

“How did you know I was meeting with Amity?” Willow asked. She hadn’t told anyone about the meeting. Well, except for Gus, and he’d promised to keep it a secret.

Gilbert took a swig of his bitterbean. “Augustus sent one of his armies of little illusion messages to your room, and they were all walking around the house asking where you were and if you’d talked with Amity yet.”

“Dang it, Gus,” Willow said softly, dragging her hand down her face.

Gil chuckled. “The Porter clan isn’t exactly known for their subtlety. I guess that comes with the territory of being Illusionists and Oracles.”

“Are any of the IMs still around?” Willow asked. “I don’t want Gus to be wasting bile just for me to not tell him anything.”

“I’m pretty sure one of the lot is going in circles on the rug downstairs in the den,” Gilbert answered, jerking his head in the direction of the stairs.

“Thanks,” Willow replied. “You promise to not tell Papa about me staying out past curfew, right?”

Gilbert nodded. “About what?” he said jokingly. “I’ve already forgotten the past three minutes. Hmm, I might have to go to a healer to get my brain checked.”

Willow laughed. “Okay, I get it.”

Heading down the stairs, Willow found a miniature version of Gus marching around in circles. “Where’s Willow? Has she talked to Amity yet? Where’s Willow? Has she talked to Amity yet?”

Willow knelt down on the rug and waved her hand in front of the tiny illusion, hoping to break it out of whatever loop it was stuck in. The hand wave seemed to do the trick, as the illusion immediately jumped in place and turned to face Willow.

“Willow\!” Mini-Gus said. “Have you talked with Amity yet?”

Willow nodded. “Yeah, I talked with her, and I’m pretty sure I’ve convinced her to ask Luz out to Grom.”

Mini-Gus pulled out a miniature notepad and began scribbling notes. “That’s awesome\! Any other findings to report?”

Willow hemmed and hawed before eventually responding with, “Nope, nothing else really.”

Mini-Gus nodded and made another small scribble on his notesheet. “Alright, I can definitely work with this. *Hasta la pasta*, Willow\!”

Willow waved goodbye before watching the Mini-Gus fade away in a non-existent wind.

Checking her scroll for the time, the plant witch saw that it was well past her normal waking hours. Quietly ascending the stairs, she snuck into her room and switched into comfy pajamas before promptly collapsing into bed and falling unconscious in seconds.

Part two of her plan would have to wait for the next day.

**Schlaftag 1, Seventh Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl House**

Luz’s tail swished back and forth as she watched King and Eda playfully squabble about what prank they should play on an Emperor’s Coven guard this week. The three were lounging around in the living room, enjoying a nice lazy day to end off the week.

“I’m just saying, if we go with your plan of spray painting an owl on their mask while they sleep, then it’ll be easy to track it back to us,” King argued.

“And why would that be?” Eda questioned, putting a hand on her hip.

“Because owls are literally your whole thing,” King replied. “You are the *Owl* Lady. This is the *Owl* House. You’d be the first suspect because duh, why wouldn’t you be.”

Eda sighed. “Dang, got me there. Fine, we’ll go with your prank.”

King gave a victorious fist pump and received a high five from Luz. “Haha, yes\! Operation ‘Summon Xarhtograz, Warlock Ruler, Master of Night Terrors and Chaos Personified’, is a go\!”

“You think we can, like, cut down the name to something that isn’t a mouthful? Maybe make it an acronym or something?” Luz suggested.

“No, we gotta say the full title or else he might smite us for not giving him his due respect,” King replied.

Luz gave an exaggerated sigh. “Fine, we can call it Operation Summon Zar–”

Hooty suddenly shot from his post and wrapped around Luz’s mouth, muffling her speech. “Never say that name unless you want to summon him\!”

When the bird worm finally relinquished his death grip around Luz’s face, she gave a confused look. “What? But King just said his name?”

“No he didn’t,” Hooty replied. “He said Xarhtograz. You were about to say Zar… hto…graz.”

“I cannot hear a difference between those two names. Like, at all,” Luz said. “Can you hear a difference, Eda?”

“How can you not hear the difference?” Eda responded with a question of her own. “Zar and Xar sound nothing alike. You got wax in your ears or something, kid?”

Luz still had no idea what the difference could possibly be. “Alright. Umm, to avoid accidentally summoning someone who shall not be mentioned, I think I’ll just call it ‘the prank plan’ from now on. So, how are we going to actually go about, y’know, summoning the big fella?”

Before anyone could answer, they were interrupted by the sound of a knock at the door. “I’ll get it\!” Luz called out quickly, hopping up to her feet and dashing over to the door.

Opening the door revealed the visitor to be a very familiar face. “Heya Willow\!” Luz said with a smile and wave. “Come on in.”

“I hope I’m not interrupting anything important,” Willow said.

“Eh, it was nothing super crazy,” Luz answered. “We were just discussing our plans to hold a summoning ritual to summon a chaos deity and play some epic pranks on some EC guards.”

“Huh, sounds fun,” Willow nodded before looking up hopefully at the Owl Lady. “Is it okay if Luz and I talk in private, Miss Eda?”

“Sure, go ahead. I won’t pry,” Eda responded.

“Thanks,” Willow replied earnestly. She then lightly grabbed Luz by the arm and dragged the two of them upstairs and into Luz’s room.

The basilisk was still confused as to what was so important to Willow that they couldn’t involve Eda or King in the conversation. After closing the door, Willow turned to the basilisk. “What do you remember about the time when your brain was on fire?” the plant witch asked. “Not when Amity, Gus, and I were in there, but like when we were at school,” she clarified.

“Uhmm…” Luz thought back. Some of her memories were a little fuzzy, and she had a pretty good idea why, but others were more clear. “I remember thinking that you and Gus were, like, weird elf creatures. And that I thought your name was Tatiana and Gus’ name was Isaac.”

“Is there anything more that you can think of? Maybe like when we were in photo class and found the burning memories, for example?” Willow continued.

Luz screwed her face up into a thinking face. “I’m not totally sure, but I think I remember Gus, like, jumping into the room like he was a cop on a TV drama. All ‘Freeze, put your hands up\!’ kinda thing.”

“Yeah, that happened,” Willow confirmed. “Anything else? Anything you might have done or said, in particular?”

Luz sucked in a breath. “I… uh… Well, I’m not totally sure if this happened, but… I have no idea if this memory is accurate, but I think I kind of remember… flirting with Amity? Kinda? Sorta? I dunno. I’m probably just making things up to fill in the blanks caused by the fire.”

That made Willow pause. “We fixed all of your memories, though. There shouldn’t be any blanks to fill in.”

Willow felt like she was watching the gears in Luz’s mind turn as she comprehended what the plant witch had said. “Wait… are you saying that I actually flirted with Amity?\!”

“I’m not saying you didn’t,” Willow said with a cheeky grin.

Luz grabbed a pillow and buried it into her face. “I HAMT MELIF I TID HAT\!”

Willow gave a short chuckle. “Can you say that without the pillow filter?”

Luz sighed and dropped the pillow, letting it fall to the floor. “I can’t believe I did that. Are you 100% sure that I really, actually flirted with Amity?”

“Yeah, I’m pretty sure,” Willow replied.

Luz slowly exhaled. “Ahhh, fudge nuggets. Is that why Amity’s been acting all weird recently? I know Jerbo said she was distracted recently. Maybe she thinks I’m really weird for flirting and she’s been trying to think of ways to let me down easy about how she doesn’t like me that way.”

Willow nearly burst out laughing, but managed to contain herself. “I wouldn’t say that.”

Luz sat up, suddenly paying much more attention. “What do you mean? What do you mean by that, Willow?”

“Well…” the plant witch started. “Do you remember our CB call we had a few days ago? And how I said that there was someone who liked you? Someone who liked you enough that they would take you out to Grom?”

Luz paled. “No. This has to be some kind of prank. Where’s the camera? When’s Gus gonna pop out and go ‘You just got bamboozled\!’?”

“No, this isn’t a prank,” Willow responded.

“So Amity actually… likes me? Like, she ‘likes me’ likes me?” Luz was still in disbelief.

“Yeah, she does,” Willow said simply.

Luz collapsed back into her bed. Double facepalming, the basilisk let out a slow, shaky breath. “*Dios mío. Le gusto mucho. Esto no puede ser real, pero lo es. Mierda.*”

Willow clapped a hand on Luz’s shoulder. “So, Amity likes you. That’s only one half of the equation, though. Do *you* like Amity?”

Luz gave a deep exhale. “I… I don’t know. I mean… Gah, this is so confusing.”

“Well, what do you like about Amity?” Willow asked.

“Lots of things,” the basilisk responded. “I like her laugh and her smile and how kind she is to kids and she always gives everything her all and how whenever I see her I get these weird feelings in my stomach…” Luz trailed off. “Ah shiitake mushrooms, I ‘like’ like Amity, don’t I?”

“Sure looks it,” Willow responded with a small laugh. “So, do you think you’re up to taking her out to Grom?”

Luz let out a slow breath. “Maybe? I don’t know. I guess I’m… scared or afraid or whatever. The last time I tried to make a big flashy spectacle thing to ask someone out to a school dance, I got rejected. What if Amity doesn’t like that kinda stuff as well? Should I try to turn down my Luz-ness, Willow? Maybe that will go better…”

Willow clapped a hand on the basilisk’s shoulder to get her attention. “Luz, look at me.”

Luz slowly raised her head to meet Willow’s eyes. “Yeah?”

“I don’t know a better way to word this, but Amity likes you… because you are you,” Willow said emphatically. “And if it turns out that the most ‘you’ thing you could do to ask her out to Grom is to serenade her with a gui-scar solo or have a barbershop quartet parade around school singing about how cute you two would be together, then *do it*.”

“So, do you have any ideas for how you’re going to ask Amity out?” Willow questioned.

Luz thought about it for a few seconds, before a smile grew on her face. She just had an idea. A wonderful, crazy, 100% guaranteed to work, foolproof, impossible to mess up idea. It was going to be the best Gromposal ever.

“Yeah, I’ve got something in mind.”
