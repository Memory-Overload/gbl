**Gehetag 2, Seventh Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Hexside School of Magic and Demonics**

Luz took a deep breath as she put her textbooks away in her locker. If she wanted to even have a chance of Amity saying yes, she would have to pull off everything perfectly. She only had one chance to pull this off, and if anything went even the slightest bit awry then it would all be for naught. Steeling herself, the basilisk closed her locker and headed off to the classroom that Willow and Gus had stationed themselves in.

"Are 100% sure that you'll have enough bile?" Luz asked, looking in Gus' direction.

The Illusionist shrugged. "It'll only be what? 30 seconds max? Not to toot my own horn, but I can do that in my sleep."

Luz gave a playful scoff. "Okay mister, you don't have to brag about your grandioso."

It was now or never. Taking one last breath to ready herself, Luz nodded. "Let's do this."

Nodding in kind, Willow exited the room, heading off to find a certain Abomination witch. While Willow was out searching for her "victim", Luz and Gus got to work preparing their portions of the Gromposal. Reaching into her backpack, Luz pulled out two things: first was *The Good Witch Azura: Battle For The Welttree* with a very specific page bookmarked via a sticky note. Tossing the book over to Gus, the boy got to reading the frankly overly-detailed description of the scene. Next, Luz withdrew a sketch that she'd made of her personal adaptation of Azura. Sure, she was going to be taking a few creative liberties, but it was still easily recognizable as the Good Witch herself. Concentrating on her morph, Luz felt herself grow taller and her hair lengthen as it began to trail down her back. Those were just the ones she could feel, though. Keeping focused on the morph, Luz willed her hair to turn the signature Azura green.

Grabbing her phone and navigating to the camera app, she examined the changes. Everything looked pretty much perfect, physically wise. Now was the hard part, though: the outfit. Azura's outfit had so many minute details that Luz had to get exactly right. From the trim pattern at the end of the cape to the shine of the gem inlaid into the hat, Luz had to match it all.

(Okay, well she didn't have to 100% be a carbon copy according to what Eda had said when she ran the idea by the Owl Lady, but Luz was also too much of a perfectionist to let even the slightest blemish go unfixed.)

Slowly, Luz's Hexside uniform shifted and changed just like her body had. The arm sleeves and leggings specifying her chosen magic tracks all turned to match the white-and-mauve color scheme, while her tunic melded into the sleeves so that it was a single piece of cloth. At the same time, her typical Hexside- approved sneakers morphed into the stylish boots Azura used to kick the butt of evil all across the universe. Finally, there was the piece de resistance: the hat. Reaching into her backpack yet again, Luz grabbed the old baseball cap that Eda had yoinked from the Human Realm. Placing the hat snug on her head, the basilisk completed the final changes of the morph from weird and nerdy Luz to the cool and awesome Azura.

Patting her hands against her cheeks, Luz remembered something. She had almost forgotten it in the rush to get ready: she needed to change her voice! The last time she had tried to impersonate a made up person, Bump had called her bluff in like 10 seconds, and Amity would probably be able to tell it was Luz even faster. Letting out a small "Dang it!", Luz got to work on shifting her vocal cords so that she sounded more like the Azura from the movie.

(The first movie, specifically, since that was the objectively better and more accurate to the source material Azura adaptation. She was still salty that the movie studio wouldn't pony up the big bucks to bring back the original actor for the second movie.)

As her vocal cords warped and changed, Luz was just making random noises, trying to get a good gauge of what she should change. Eventually, she settled on a voice that was a fair bit deeper than her own and was just a touch gravelly. That would be good enough for now.

Luz let out a slow breath. "Alright. I think I'm ready. You ready, Gustanamo?"

"Yup!" he replied. "This shouldn't be too bad, all things considered. Not lots of moving parts, which is nice."

"Well then, shall we get in our places?" Luz asked.

"I'll go hide in the corner," Gus said.

"Hey, you're the most important part, man," Luz said, giving him a side hug. "You're bringing this whole thing to life, so give yourself some credit."

"I guess," he said reluctantly. Looking down at his watch, he checked the time. "Willow and Amity will probably be here soon, so I need to hide. What's the human saying? 'Break an egg'?"

Luz laughed at the boy's malapropism. "Break a *leg*, I think you mean."

Gus gasped and leaned back, a look of disgust on his face. "Eww, what?! Why would you want someone to get hurt? How is that a good thing?"

"Actors are weird," Luz simply replied. "And beyond that, uhh... I dunno why they say it, actually." Shaking her head, she refocused on the task at hand. "Regardless, we need to get in position."

Nodding, Gus hid himself behind a collection of cauldrons and started spinning up the illusion. Luz, for her part, just had to be out of direct eyesight of the door which wasn't too hard to do, just taking a few steps to the side and posing herself to be all magical and graceful like how the real Azura would carry herself.

As the door to the classroom slowly opened, Luz said a silent prayer to whoever was listening that this would go off without a hitch.

---

Amity was getting a little tired of following Willow through the maze that was Hexside's hallways. The Plant witch had shown up out of nowhere and just grabbed her by the arm and told her to follow, and it wasn't like Amity had a good reason to retaliate. Classes weren't for another 20 minutes, and Amity could count on Professor Hermonculus to spend the first 10 minutes of class so busy degrading the students that he wouldn't notice her absence, so that meant Amity had plenty of time for... whatever this was.

"Just one more turn and we'll be there," Willow said.

"Seriously, Willow, why are we going so out of the way?" Amity asked.

"You'll see," Willow stopped in front of a random door and smiled. "Head on in."

Sighing and rolling her eyes, Amity slowly pushed the door open.

There was a lot of things that Amity was thinking this could have been. Maybe it was Willow trying to get back into Abominations and she wanted Amity to give her a few pointers. Maybe there was some grave world-ending danger on the loose and they needed to fight it off. There was a lot of possibilities going through Amity's mind about what could be on the other side of the door.

Whatever they were, though, was nothing compared to what she actually saw. It was if someone had taken the Garden of Grand Reveals and brought it to life inside the classroom. Trees of all colors and varieties stood tall, reaching up into the sky, far beyond what should've been possible. Stumblebees flitted to and fro, pollinating the many flowers that sprouted from the earth below their feet. Amity could even hear the rapids of the Raging Red River far off in the distance.

Beyond all that, though, was one thing that caught Amity's eye. Standing in the middle of the Garden was the Good Witch Azura, letting the gentle breeze flow through her hair and ruffle her cape in a scene that looked straight out of a storybook.

"Azura?!" Amity couldn't believe her eyes at who stood before her.

"Greetings and salutations, traveler," Azura said, turning to face the newcomer and bowing low.

"You're... you're real!" Amity was trying her best to hold back her excitement, but she was talking with freaking *Azura*!

"Yes, I do believe I am," Azura said with a small smile.

"How -" Amity stumbled over her words. "How are you are here? Why are you here?"

Azura let out a sigh. "Well, it is quite a story, I must say. Would you be willing to listen?"

Amity nodded fervently. "Uh huh, yeah, tell me!" She answered maybe a tad too eagerly.

Azura nodded stoically. "It all started around a month ago. I was just about to finally defeat the nefarious Gildersnake and banish it for all eternity, when I felt an odd force. It was like I was being separated from reality. When I finally awoke, I was here in the Boiling Isles. I was originally going to try to return to my own reality as quick as I could, but something compelled me to stay here. To explore. And through that exploration, I've discovered something. While I've had enough adventures to last me a dozen lifetimes, this world offered me one even greater than all of my previous escapades combined."

"Really, what is it?" Amity was on the edge of her proverbial seat.

"I'm not quite sure what I would call it," Azura admitted. "But I think you would be a great companion for me on this adventure. I only have one question for you, though."

Suddenly, Azura stood up straight and removed her hat. Looking Amity in the eye, her face began to shift and change, her hair becoming shorter and darker, her eyes changing in a flash from green to golden brown. After what felt like an eternity, but was realistically only a few seconds, the face of Luz Noceda was looking back at her.

"Amity Blight, will you go to Grom with me?"

Amity fainted.

---

Luz rushed to catch the falling Amity, scooping her up before there was unfortunate meeting between her face and the floor. Thinking quickly, the basilisk dragged the unconscious witch over to one of the desks that they'd moved over to the wall and sat Amity down in it.

Willow and Gus quickly joined Luz in checking up on their friend, but they were careful not to crowd her.

"Well... she didn't say no?" Luz said with a shaky laugh.

Willow shot her a look. "I don't think now is the best time to be making jokes."

As quickly as she had passed out, though, Amity regained consciousness. The witch rubbed at her forehead as she slowly sat up. "Luz? Willow? Gus? What... What happened? How did I get here? I just had this crazy dream. It was - it was like I got transported into the Garden of Grand Reveals, and Azura was there... but then Azura turned into Luz? And then Luz-Azura... asked me out to Grom?"

Luz quickly looked to Willow and Gus for advice about what to do here. Willow made an "are you serious right now" gesture by bringing her palms together and pointing them at the basilisk. Gus just shrugged his shoulders.

Sucking it up, Luz gently placed a hand on Amity's shoulder. "Amity, that wasn't a dream."

"Huh," Amity replied oh so eloquently. "Wait... so you --"

"Morphed into Azura and had Gus conjure up an illusion of the Garden so I could ask you out to Grom," Luz finished for her. "Yeah, yeah I did. I never got an actual answer from you, by the way."

Amity slowly rose from the desk with a little help from Luz. "Wow. I mean... It's just... *wow*." She gave a small laugh. "And here I thought me wanting to ask you out to Grom would be the hardest part of my day. You beat me to the punch, Noceda." The witch reached into her back pocket and withdrew a folded up note that was lavender in color. She quietly held out the note for Luz to take. "If you want your answer, then read this and I think you can make an educated guess."

Luz grabbed the note from Amity and slowly unfolded it.

<div class="gromNote" style="

Luz,

to Grom with me?

<center>- Amity</center>
</div>

Luz looked down at the note, and then back up at its author. "I'd love to go to Grom with you, Amity."

Amity let out a small laugh and sighed. "Phew, that makes me feel so much better. Well, I guess that means the next thing I have do is pick out an outfit for the big night."

"I'm sure you'll look stunning in whatever outfit you come up with," Luz said.

"That's easy for you to say," Amity responded. "You can just shapeshift into whatever outfit you want at a moment's notice."

"Hey, I would just be using my natural abilities. Is that a crime or something?" Luz asked rhetorically.

"Are you sure you two aren't already girlfriends 'or something'?" Willow intoned.

Luz blew a raspberry in response, which drew a laugh from Amity.

"Hey, uh, hate to break up a touching moment, but we all have class in like 5 minutes," Gus pointed out.

Luz let out an exaggerated groan. "Fiiiine, I guess we can go be good students."

---

For one certain basilisk, she was having trouble focusing on her classes. She could still barely believe that everything had gone so smoothly. (Well, except for the whole 'Amity fainting' thing, but that could be brushed under the rug.) She actually had a date to Grom! Like, for real and she wasn't getting pranked!

"Miss Noceda?" A voice suddenly snapped her out of her trance.

Luz snapped to attention, but she still had no idea what she was being called on for. "Sorry, can you repeat the question?"

"When brewing Wyvern's Breath, what is the ratio for spider venom and firebee honey?" Mr. Bonecrusher asked.

Luz paused as she thought back to the recipe book. "Uhh... Four ounces of venom for each ounce of honey?"

"Got the right numbers, but backwards. The ratio should be 4:1 in the other direction." Bonecrusher corrected.

Suddenly, the bell screamed, indicating the end of the class. As Luz began to pack up her cauldron and backpack, she was stopped when Bonecrusher called on her again. "Miss Noceda, if you could stay for a minute after, please."

After finishing packing her bag, Luz slung it over her shoulder and walked up to Bonecrusher's desk. Rocking on the balls of her feet, she opened with, "I'm guessing this is about me spacing out in class?"

Bonecrusher nodded. "That would be correct. You're usually quite attentive during lecture, and I have to say it's a rare sight to see you mess up a comparatively simple question. Is there anything that I need to know about?"

Luz sighed. "I guess you could say so. It's just... today I asked out a girl to Grom and she actually said yes. Well, she didn't actually explicitly say yes, but she asked me out as well, so I think that counts? I don't exactly have a great track record when it comes to those kinds of things, so I guess that's why I've been --"

The teacher raised his hand, signalling for Luz to stop. "Well, in that case I would first congratulate you on finding a Grom partner. But, I don't want that to interfere with your learning in my class, or any of the other classes you're taking. Your education is important, after all."

"Got it. I'll be better about paying attention tomorrow," Luz said with a smile.

Luz left Bonecrusher's classroom with the biggest of peps in her step, her mind still buzzing with excitement. Grom was gonna be awesome! As she walked down the hallway, she spotted her locker and made a beeline for it.

Opening her locker with a quick tickle, Luz unzipped her backpack and started swapping out her books for the next class. She couldn't help but smile to herself as she thought about Grom night and the inevitable dance with Amity. Luz thought of herself as a pretty good dancer, having watched enough of those trashy teenage princess movies from Sinsney that she could probably pull of whatever those dance-twirly things were with Amity.

As Luz reached to give Juanito the "you can close now" chin scratch, the public announce system screeched to life, and the voice of Principal Bump echoed through the halls. "Students of Hexside, it is now time for the moment you have all been waiting for: the announcement of this year's Grom Royalty. The selection process was particularly challenging this time round, but I have come to a conclusion. This student has shown a mastery of their craft well beyond their years while being a model student in all aspects, and I wouldn't choose anyone else if given the opportunity. This year's Grom Royalty is... Amity Blight!"

Luz, Willow, Gus, and all the other students turned to look at the named witch, hoping to get a glimpse of her reaction to the news. Amity, for her part, dropped her backpack and sprinted down the hall and rounded the corner.

"We should go check on her," Luz said after a beat. Reaching down, she snagged Amity's backpack off the ground. "And get this back to her."

The trio eventually stopped outside of a bathroom when they could hear the sound of Amity talking to herself inside. As the group entered, Gus conjured up an illusion of an "out of order" sign hanging on the door so that they could have some privacy.

"Amity?" Luz took the initiative of starting the conversation.

"Luz? Shouldn't you be in class?" Amity responded, her voice coming from behind a closed stall door.

"Class can wait," Luz said. "Also, Willow and Gus are here too. But, hey! You're Grom Queen! Bump called you a kick-butt student! Isn't that something to be proud of? Not really getting 'you should hide in the bathroom' vibes from what he said."

Amity sighed and opened the stall door. Her hair, normally tied up in a ponytail, hung across her face, and the sleeves of her uniform had been rolled up past her elbow. "I know," she said softly. "It's just... Grom is... a big deal. What if I'm not cut out to battle it? The last time I was faced with a giant monstrosity was with the Slitherbeast, and you all know how that turned out. I just froze up and you had to come in and save my butt."

Luz took a step closer and placed a hand on Amity's shoulder. "Look, Amity. If Bump picked you out of every single student here at Hexside, then that means you have to be doing something right at least. And if Bump believes in you, then I can believe in you, Willow and Gus can believe in you, everyone can."

"Yeah. I know you're going to send Grom packing," Gus said with a quick one-two punch combo to the air. "Fight will barely last a minute."

"I wouldn't be that cocky," Willow said to Gus. "But, yeah, you've got this in the bag, Amity. Grom won't stand a chance."

Amity gave a small smile. "Thanks, guys. I think we should probably all get back to class before Bump sends the trouble guards after us for skipping."

Willow and Gus were the first to exit the bathroom, heading off to their respective classes. Luz, meanwhile, stayed behind to help Amity look presentable for the outside world. Grabbing a large swathe of paper towels, Luz held them out to Amity so she could clean up the tears and snot marks that were very un-Blight. When Luz moved to join the rest of her friends back in their learning, Amity grabbed her arm to hold her back.

"Luz, I don't want you to do anything stupid, alright?" Amity said, her grip tight around the basilisk's wrist.

"What do you mean 'don't do anything stupid'?" Luz asked in kind.

"I mean... Look, back on the Knee, you had to jump in and save my butt from that angry slitherbeast. I caused that whole situation, though, so I should've been the one to fix it. Now that I'm facing Grom though, I don't want you to interfere, okay? I want to... prove it to myself that I'm not some baby who needs saving everytime I'm faced with something dangerous." Amity finished with a nearly-pleading look in Luz's direction. "Please, just let me fight my own battle on this, okay?"

Luz inhaled through her nose before slowly exhaling. "Deal. I won't interfere."

Amity nodded. "Thank you, Luz. I can't wait to enojy Grom with you. The party, I mean. Not the battle. You stay out of that, got it?"

Luz laughed, "Yeah, yeah, I get it. I can't wait for Grom either."

**Zorntag 2, Seventh Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl House**

As Luz threw open the front door to the Owl House after returning from her day at school, she wasn't totally sure what to expect. Amity brandishing a giant sword while Eda gave her tips on her grip was very much not on her top 10, though. Top 300, maybe?

"Uhh... hi?" Luz said after a few seconds of staring at the other two awkwardly.

"Hey, kiddo," Eda said nonchalantly, all the while adjusting Amity's hand placement around the hilt of the sword. "Hope ya didn't think Blight here had gone missing while you were spreading your multi-tracking propaganda after getting out of learning prison." The Owl Lady turned back to continue her lesson with Amity. "Look, if you want to actully give Grom a solid chop, you're gonna have to be sure that your grip is right. Trying to hack at Fear Monster General won't do you good if your swings are weak."

Amity nodded and readied the sword before swinging it in a downward arc, slicing clean through a fruit that Eda was levitating. Letting the now-halved fruit fall to the ground, Eda smiled and gave Amity a pat on the back. "Good on ya, Blight. You're a natural at this."

Luz was still somehwat confused as to why this was even happening in the first place. "Eda... umm... why does Amity have a sword? She has magic, and I think that's way more dangerous to Grom than simply cutting it up."

"I thought that too, kiddo," Eda answered. "But you've gotta remember that magic is tied to emotion. If Amity is all spooked by Grom, then that'll muck up whatever attempts she'll try at magic. Cold steel, though, doesn't give a hoot about your emotions and just cuts whatever you swing it at. So even if Mittens is scared out of her socks, she'll still have a weapon she can fall back on."

Luz nodded. "Ohhh. That nakes a lot of sense, actually."

Eda grinned. "Yeah, I'm not gonna let my kid's date die if I can have a say in it."

Suddenly, Luz was struck by an idea. "Hey, Amity?"

Amity perked up at hearing Luz call her name. "Yeah?"

"Well, I just had a brain thought from my noggin." Luz explained. "Grom is all about scaring you, yeah? Well, what if when Grom tries to turn into whatever spooks you, you aren't spooked?"

Amity paused as she thought that over. "Huh, that *could* help, but how would I be able to face the manifestations of my --" She stopped when she saw Luz's blank look. "Right, basilisk, shapeshifting. Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt. You just have to promise to not make fun of my fears, all right?"

Luz nodded. "Your fears will be safe with me."

---

"Come on, Amity!" Luz shouted. "If Grom is gonna turn into your worst fear, than you're gonna have to punch that fear *in the face*!"

In the front lawn of the Owl House, Luz and Amity were going through what the basilisk lovingly referred to as "fear fighting bootcamp". Luz was using her shapeshifting to turn into nightmarish forms of all of Amity's fears. Well, the ones that had physical form, anyway. It wasn't like Luz could exactly morph into "the crushing anxiety that I'll never meet my mother's expectations."

Currently, Luz was in the form of a monstrous zombie-like entity. Her skin was an unnatural bright red, and her eyes were ringed in a pitch black. Holes peppered her flesh, at some points being entirely missing, revealing the black bones underneath the skin and muscle and tissue. Luz could totally see why this creature had haunted young Amity's dreams.

"Luz, I still don't want to punch you in the face with an Abomination gauntlet," Amity said plainly.

"I can just heal up in, like, three seconds," Luz countered. "Come on, you've been stalling for 10 minutes now. Just punch me in the face. I'm Grom, and I'm gonna get ya!"

Amity took a deep breath. "Are you totally sure that I won't hurt you?"

Luz nodded, "Positive. Now punch me already."

The abomination witch sighed and cocked back her fist, Abomination goop gathering around it before solidifying into a gauntlet. As her fist rocketed forward, Luz decided to play up Amity's strength. When gauntlet met seemingly-rotting flesh, the basilisk stumbled backward and fell to a knee.

Luz looked up and met Amity's eye. "See how easy that was? Now you've just got to do that to the actual Grom like 5 times or whatever."

Amity, still hesitant, lowered her gauntlet-clad fist. "I know you say you'll be fine, but I can't help but worry. What if I actually hurt you?"

Luz, noting Amity's distress, quickly morphed back into her human form, a warm smile gracing her features. Walking over to the despondent witch, she gently placed a hand on her shoulder. "Hey, it's okay to be worried. Fighting Grom is a big deal, yeah, but you gotta remember that you're not alone in this. You've got me, Willow, Gus, Eda, King, Ed and Em -- heck even Bump! -- Everybody's backing you up. And personally, I'm not gonna let my first real date-dance-thing get ruined by some cut-rate horror movie monster."

Amity laughed at Luz's joke, but her smile dropped after a few seconds. "I know that, but what if I freeze up again?"

Luz sidled up to Amity and draped an arm over her shoulder. "Well, if you're Grom Queen, then that means I'm Grom... Consort or something, and it's my job to protect you if poo hits the fan."

Amity smirked and snuck out from under Luz's grasp before turning to face the basilisk. "I'm not sure that's a real title, but if it'll help you feel better than you can be my Grom Consort."

After a few seconds of silence in which the two simply enjoyed the silence, Luz spoke up. "Do you think we should call it for fear training today?"

Amity simply nodded. Taking that as her sign to head back in, Luz went upstairs to check on what King and Eda were doing. Luz knew they were doing something in the Owl Lady's bedroom, but she couldn't make out much more than that from what little she could see going on through the giant stained-glass window.

"Hey, guys!" Luz said as she entered the room. Eda was standing on top of a stool, and she wore a patched-up brown suit. Honestly, it wasn't a bad look. King, for his part, was dressed as a ferocious little fashionista.

"Sup, kiddo. Fear training go good?" Eda asked, moving her arm so King could check the stitching of the elbow patch.

"It went... alright? I think?" Luz answered slowly, not really sure of the answer.

"Well, if it'll calm your nerves, just know that I'm gonna be at the shindig, too," Eda supplied. "Bumpy-poo 'offered' me to chaperone."

"He blackmailed you, didn't he?" Luz said with a cocked eyebrow.

"I won't say he did blackmail me, but I'm not saying he didn't," Eda replied.

King laughed. "Do you wanna know the blackmail?" he questioned Luz.

Luz gave a devious chuckle. "Ooh, gimme the Eda backstory."

King hopped down from Eda's arm and scampered over right up to Luz's ear. As he whispered, Luz couldn't believe what she was hearing. "No way. Eda did that?!"

The tiny demon nodded. "Yeah! I know, right?"

Eda, not going to let her bad girl reputation be tarnished, loudly cleared her throat to draw attention. "Luz, if you're gonna be going out with the Grom Queen, you're going to have to look the part as well. Do you have any idea on what you're gonna wear?"

Luz perked up at the mention of her outfit of choice. "Ooh, yeah, I've actually got this fun idea. So it's basically going to be like a dress-suit hybrid outfit thingy. So, like a blazer and tie and stuff up top, but then a skirt or tutu or something down low."

"Hmmm..." Eda thought on what that would look like. "You got a picture or something that I could look at? Kinda struggling to picture it in my mind's eye."

"I'm glad you asked," Luz said coyly, before she morphed into the outfit right then and there. "So... what do you think?" She gave a quick twirl so that Eda could see it from all the angles. When she was back facing Eda, she batted her eyelashes to up the cuteness. "Do you think Amity's gonna like it?"

Eda gave a breathy laugh. "Amity's gonna love it, kiddo."
