<p><strong>Second Lunar Disappearance, 12 CE | Somewhere on the
outskirts of the Left Hand</strong></p>
<p>Tonight, it was Jara's turn to keep watch as the others slept.</p>
<p>They had gotten lucky the past few days, but Jara knew better than to
put his faith in luck. Something was bound to go wrong. That was how the
universe worked. It would lull you into relaxing before driving a dagger
through your chest. That was how they had lost Toby. They had been
foolish to blindly accept the help of a guard. That would never happen
again.</p>
<p>Shaking his head to clear out the depressing thoughts, Jara turned
from his post outside the makeshift tent and looked in on his sleeping
wife and child. Ket looked as beautiful as ever. When the moonlight
caught her aquamarine scales just right, they would give off the
prettiest shine. She slept peacefully, arm draped over Manil in a soft,
but firm, grasp. Manil was the cutest little basilisk one could ever
see, with his light brown scales and a cute little nose with that small
white birthmark on it that looked like a smile. Likewise, a small smile
crept onto Jara's face. He enjoyed these moments, fleeting as they were,
where a family and their newborn could simply relax, not having to worry
about when their next meal would be, or how much longer they'll have to
run from the Emperor's Coven.</p>
<p>After giving his wife a quick kiss on the forehead, Jara returned to
his lookout duty. The night was uneventful so far. A few rogue fairies
had given him a small reprieve from the monotonous nothingness of the
surrounding woods, but other than that the area was free of any other
signs of life. He felt himself begin to succumb to sleep when he heard a
noise off in the distance. It sounded like feet, making their way
through the woods. Jara estimated there to be about five people in the
approaching party based off the cadence of the footsteps. Suddenly, a
shout broke through the rustling of leaves.</p>
<p>"We know where you are, demons! Just give yourselves over, and we'll
make your deaths less painful."</p>
<p>Quickly, Jara opened the tent flap and shook Ket. His wife was scared
by the sudden awakening, shooting upright.</p>
<p>"Ahh! What in the name of the Titan are you doing?"</p>
<p>"We have to leave. Hunters are close by and could show up at any
minute. We need to go now! You get Manil and run, I'll fight off the
hunters."</p>
<p>"Are you sure you can handle them?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Now go!"</p>
<p>Jara was lying. He knew this fight would end in his death. He knew
that, and he accepted that. As long as his family was safe, that was all
that mattered. Jara quickly began shifting forms, going from species to
species as fast as possible. He depleted his reserves as much as he
could without leaving himself sluggish. A hungry basilisk is a dangerous
basilisk, after all.</p>
<p>Jara made his way out the front of the tent and waited. He looked
around the area. Nothing was happening. Not a single butterknifefly,
griffin, or demon hunter in sight.</p>
<p>"Hey! I'm right here! Come fight me face to face!"</p>
<p>Still nothing.</p>
<p>Deciding to go on the offensive, Jara began walking around the
perimeter, making as much noise as he could.</p>
<p>"Come on! What are you, scared?"</p>
<p>A fireball flew past his face, narrowly missing.</p>
<p>"There we go! How hard was that?"</p>
<p>Jara laughed. He turned to face whoever had thrown that. He didn't
know how long he was going to fight, but he did know that he was going
to be dining in Fólkvangr by sunrise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ket took off running out the back of the tent. One hand
was carrying her child while the other was shifted into a sword,
knocking away obstacles. The forests of the Left Hand were notorious for
their hard to traverse terrain, and this patch was no exception. Tree
branches swatted at her face, vines tangled her feet, and fairies
screamed of their lust for skin, but she kept running.</p>
<p>Eventually, she grew tired. Her body was giving up on her. Her legs
were burning, and her breathing was labored. She needed to find a place
to slow down and catch her breath. Leaning her back against a nearby
tree, she took those deep breaths like she had practiced. In-2-3-4,
Out-2-3-4, In-2-3-4, Out-2-3-4. That was better. Manil had also calmed
down as well, nestling into the crook of her elbow and taking a nap. As
she slowly looked around and took in the surrounding scenery, she
noticed a lake that miraculously wasn't boiling. Ever the opportunist,
Ket made her way over to the body of water and gave it a closer look.
She had to make sure there weren't any creatures lurking under the
surface before she could risk taking a drink.</p>
<p>As she scrutinized the lake further, she noticed that it had an
odd-looking shine to it, like it wasn't water that was lapping at the
edges of the sand, but something else entirely. It was an odd color as
well, being a navy blue instead of the normal gray and red hues found in
other bodies of water on the Isles. Suddenly, a long-forgotten memory
arose. Ket had heard stories about lakes like this. Her grandfather had
told her that these spots were where the blood of the Titan and water
had mixed together, ripping a hole in the fabric of reality and creating
a portal between the realms.</p>
<p>Deciding to test her theory, she squatted down and dipped her finger
into the lake. As her finger initially broke the surface, the lake felt
warm and welcoming, but it eventually gave way to a cool and dry
sensation, and she felt a light wind blowing just below the surface. Ket
retracted her finger and stood up.</p>
<p>Ket then did what any sane demon would do in her situation: She
closed her eyes, tucked Manil close to her chest, and dove into the
lake.</p>
<p><strong>July 16, 1983 | Outside the city limits of Neustadt,
Pennsylvania</strong></p>
<p>Ket slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>She looked down and saw Manil, still asleep and dreaming peacefully.
Looking back up, she saw buildings on the horizon. However, she had
never seen buildings that looked like these ones before.</p>
<p>Ket smiled.</p>
<p>They were free.</p>
<h1 id="luz-gets-a-reality-check">Luz Gets A Reality Check</h1>
<p><strong>Friday, May 7, 2021 | Gravesfield, Connecticut</strong></p>
<p>Camila Noceda had had a relatively light day so far, working as the
head of Happy Pets Clinic. Rudy, a feisty Jack Russell terrier, had to
get 27 porcupine quills removed from his snout, while Theodore, an
energetic Cocker Spaniel mix, needed a steroid injection for allergies,
and that was much easier said than done. The rest of the day had been
uneventful, however. Camila had just slumped down at her chair in the
break room when her phone began to ring.</p>
<p>Digging her phone out of her purse, she instantly recognized the
number, belonging to the front office of Gravesfield High School.
Quickly tapping the <em>Accept Call</em> button, Camila brought the
phone up to her ear.</p>
<p>“Hello, this is Camila Noceda.”</p>
<p>“Hi Dr. Noceda. Your daughter Luz has been sent to Principal Hal’s
office for her disruptive behavior in her English class. Since this is
past her second offense, we’re required to contact you and have you
appear with her while appropriate disciplinary action is taken.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for letting me know. I’ll be on my way shortly. Have a
good day.”</p>
<p>“Likewise, Dr. Noceda.”</p>
<p>Camila ended the call and then let out a long sigh. She loved Luz and
her creativity, she really did, but it sometimes got out of hand. Luz
would get so engrossed in her latest art project or book report that she
would forget to think about how others might react.</p>
<p>Taking a look at the schedule for the rest of the day, there wasn’t
much left to do, and nothing that Camila 100% needed to be there for, so
she decided to take the rest of the day off to be with Luz.</p>
<p>Packing up her belongings, Camila realized she needed to let the rest
of the staff know that she would be leaving early. Luckily, Carmen and
Dianne were the only other people working this shift, so that would be
pretty easy.</p>
<p>“Hey Carmen!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Dr. N?”</p>
<p>“I need to go right now. Do you think you can cover the rest of my
patients?”</p>
<p>“Totally. I’m finishing up with Cassie right now, so I won’t have
much more after that.”</p>
<p>“Awesome. Thank you, Carmen. Can you let Dianne know I’ll be gone, as
well?”</p>
<p>“Yup. No worries, Dr. N.”</p>
<p>“Great. Thanks, again.”</p>
<p>As Camila pulled into the parking lot of Gravesfield High School, she
steeled herself as she opened the doors to the building that had been
the source of many nightmares. After checking in with the front desk and
being given a small nametag declaring her a visitor, she made her way
over to the office of Principal Hal.</p>
<p>Closing the office door, Camila saw her daughter with a forlorn look
on her face, and Principal Hal with a disgruntled look on his.</p>
<p>“Hi, mom,” Luz said quietly.</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming on such short notice, Dr. Noceda,” Hal
said.</p>
<p>Camila took a seat next to her daughter before turning to face the
principal.</p>
<p>“So, what exactly is it that I was called here for? I know that Luz
was ‘disruptive’ in class, but that’s it. Would you care to enlighten me
on the situation?”</p>
<p>“Well for starters, your daughter brought a live snake to class and
used it as a prop in her book report.”</p>
<p>Camila’s eyes shot over to make contact with Luz’s.</p>
<p>“You brought Reggie with you to school? Luz, what have I told you,
you have to keep Reggie at home and in his terrarium!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, <em>mamá</em>.”</p>
<p>“I know, <em>mija</em>, but you also have to be a responsible pet
owner. Reggie could have hurt one of the other students, or even been
hurt himself. Do you understand that?”</p>
<p>“Yes <em>mamá</em>. Look, he’s fine. He was never in danger.” Luz
then pulled Reggie out from her backpack, and the snake coiled himself
around his owner’s left arm.</p>
<p>“That’s good and all, but you still have to be careful, okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay, mom.”</p>
<p>Principal Hal then drew the attention back onto him by opening one of
the drawers to the side of his desk. The loud <em>SKRRRRT</em> was
grating to everyone’s ears. Hal then pulled out a small pamphlet and
placed it on his desk.</p>
<p>Luz and Camila both moved up closer to get a better look at the
flyer. “Reality Check Summer Camp” was printed at the top in a garish
font, and a picture of a boy being trapped inside a box made it even
worse. The obviously fake smile on the kid’s face, along with the
tagline of “Think <u>inside</u> the box!” didn’t help much either.</p>
<p>“In light of Luz’s recent incidents, I believe that this camp would
be of great benefit to her, and it would also give her the chance to
make friends with other children her own age. This is an optional
activity, though. If you do take up the offer, it would last the entire
summer break.”</p>
<p>The two Nocedas looked over the pamphlet as it proclaimed how Reality
Check Summer Camp would teach campers about the “Wonders of Public
Radio” and “Doing Your Taxes: The Fun Way!” The document looked like it
hadn’t been updated in decades, with the “The Sharing Initiative © 2001”
at the bottom of the last page being a dead giveaway.</p>
<p>“I’ll let you two talk this over amongst yourselves. If you could get
back with a decision by next Monday, then we could start the signup
process then. There is no rush, however. Signing up only takes a few –”
Hal was cut off by Reggie uncoiling himself from Luz’s arm and striking
at the man.</p>
<p>“REGGIE, NO!” Luz yelled, as she quickly pulled her pet off the
shocked principal. She hastily slipped Reggie into her backpack and
zipped it mostly shut, leaving a small gap at the top. Reggie still
needed to breathe, of course. Luz wasn’t a monster.</p>
<p>“I am so sorry, Principal Hal,” Luz stammered out. She noticed the
vitiligo markings on her hands start to grow a little larger. That was
probably just a trick of the light or stress messing with her brain.</p>
<p>“You should be. That <em>thing</em> nearly killed me,” Hal then
composed himself before continuing, “Alright, Noceda. I was originally
going to give you the choice of going to Reality Check Camp, but now you
have forced my hand. You’ll be attending, whether you like it or not.
Consider this extended academic action. Now, please go with your mother
and leave this school before I have a resource officer escort you
out.”</p>
<h1 id="luz-races-an-owl">Luz Races An Owl</h1>
<p><strong>Saturday, May 22, 2021 | 8:24 A.M. | The Noceda
Household</strong></p>
<p>Luz gave her luggage for camp one last look over.</p>
<p>The blue duffel bag had about 2 weeks’ worth of clothes in it, mainly
consisting of cargo/athletic shorts, t-shirts, hoodies, and a few pairs
of jeans. Some leggings and an ill-fitting button-up shirt were also
scrunched in there last minute just in case she needed something more
formal. With some creative outfit combos, she could wear a new outfit
every single day of camp if she wanted to. (Knowing Luz, though, she
would probably just end up wearing her favorite blue-and-white cat
hoodie most of the time.)</p>
<p>The black-and-green duffel bag held her larger items. Her personal
laptop (Somehow, it was still chugging along even after all these years.
“The AMV-inator”, as Luz called it, ran really well, considering its
age.), the laptop’s power cable, her drawing tablet, the tablet’s
charger, her sketchpad, and a few charcoal pencils. She wanted to have
every possible creative outlet at her disposal if an idea struck
her.</p>
<p>Finally, there was her backpack, which contained her most important
possessions: her phone, its charger, and Good Witch Azura books 1-5. She
would only be taking the standard versions of the books though, as she
didn’t want to risk her Collector’s Editions being ruined by some snobby
bully with no taste for such literary masterpiece. She had saved up her
allowance for nearly two months to buy that set from her local
Applegrant Bookshop, and the books sat proudly on her shelf, surrounded
on all sides by all the Azura and Hecate figurines she had collected
over her years in the GWA fandom.</p>
<p>“Luz, are you almost ready to go?”</p>
<p>“<em>Sí</em>, <em>mamá</em>. Just making sure I have everything
packed up.”</p>
<p>In his terrarium, Reggie had apparently been awoken by the sudden
noise of conversation, as he began looking around, head swiveling to and
fro. Noticing her pet, Luz walked over to the baby green tree python and
squatted down to be level with him.</p>
<p>“Alright, Reggie. I’m gonna be gone for a while. That means that mom
is going to be taking care of you. You have to promise to be good for
mom, okay? Can you do that for me?” Reggie quickly flicked his tongue in
and out, tasting the air in a gesture that Luz took to mean <em>Yes</em>
in Snake-ese.</p>
<p>“Nice chat.” Reggie responded by slumping to the floor of the
terrarium and doing his best impression of an over-cooked spaghetti
noodle.</p>
<p>Swinging her backpack on and grabbing a duffel bag in each hand, Luz
made her way downstairs to the main foyer. She then let her mom know she
was ready for camp with a shout of, “How much time till the bus gets
here?”</p>
<p>“It won’t be here for another 30 minutes, <em>cariño</em>.”</p>
<p>Sighing, Luz set down her bags and walked into the kitchen to get
some last-minute breakfast before heading off to camp. Opening the
fridge revealed a dearth of any appealing food options. Three-day-old
Chinese food wasn’t exactly the most nutritional breakfast one could
have.</p>
<p>Switching over to the pantry, she saw a lone package of instant
oatmeal with a ginger and maple flavor. Deciding better this than
nothing, Luz skimmed the instructions on the packaging and quickly
prepared the meal.</p>
<p>The oatmeal was ok. A solid 6.5/10.</p>
<p>Looking at the clock on the wall, the bus was supposed to arrive in
about 15 minutes. Picking up her bags and walking out the door with an
“I’m gonna go wait outside!”, Luz readied herself for the worst and most
boring three months of her life.</p>
<p>She waited for the bus to arrive.</p>
<p>And waited.</p>
<p>And waited some more.</p>
<p>Eventually, her shoulders began to ache, so she set her bags down. It
had definitely been more than 15 minutes. It had to have been. Maybe the
bus was just running late? That could happen. So Luz waited even
longer.</p>
<p>Luz gave up. She turned to walk back inside when she heard a
<em>HOOT</em> sound. Turning to locate the noise, she saw a tiny owl
with her backpack in its beak. The owl met eyes with her and it looked
like it had gotten caught red-handed. (<em>Or would it be
red-winged?</em> Luz thought to herself) The owl turned and started
hopping away as fast as possible, backpack still in tow.</p>
<p>“Oh no you don’t!” Luz yelled, and the chase was on. Luz sprinted
after the little owl, who was deceptively fast. Every time she thought
she was going to catch the fleeing avian, the owl started hopping a
little bit faster and was out of her reach again. The owl ended up
hopping its way into an old, abandoned house through an open front door
and disappearing from Luz’s line of sight.</p>
<p>Luz was normally against doing things like breaking the law, but in
this one incredibly rare instance, she didn’t care. It was time for a
little breaking and entering. Maybe. All Luz knew was that she wanted
her bag back. So with a primal scream, Luz ran through the open door.
Suddenly, the door behind her slammed shut and a bright yellow light
filled her vision.</p>
<p>Camila looked out her bedroom window, expecting to see her daughter
getting ready to hop on the bus to camp.</p>
<p>Luz was nowhere to be seen. Her bags were still there, but their
owner wasn’t.</p>
<p>“<em>Mija,</em> you forgot your bags outside.”</p>
<p>No response.</p>
<p>“Luz? Hello? Are you here?”</p>
<p>Still nothing. It wasn’t like Luz to give the silent treatment.
Something was off about this.</p>
<p>Camila ran down the stairs and outside. The realization slowly set
in.</p>
<p>Luz was gone.</p>
<p><strong>30 Minutes Later</strong></p>
<p>A bus pulled up to the Noceda household. Traffic had been absolutely
awful, and they were nearly a half hour late because of it. Nobody was
there, and no cars were in the driveway. The driver simply shrugged and
drove to the next house on their list. They weren’t paid enough to care
about one kid being late.</p>
<h1 id="luz-fraternizes-with-a-criminal">Luz Fraternizes With A
Criminal</h1>
<p><strong>Kaufetag 2, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Bonesborough,
B.I.</strong></p>
<p>“Give me back my bag you —” Luz cut herself off when she opened her
eyes after being flashbanged by the door closing. The old, dilapidated
house with its torn up floorboards and tattered wallpaper had been
replaced with a hodgepodge of seemingly random items stuffed into a
giant tent of some kind.</p>
<p>She looked around. At her feet, a creature with the head of a baby
doll and the body of a lizard had been impaled on a clothes hanger.
Above her, a shovel hung from the rafters, while a cracked portable TV
from the 90s (Probably? Luz wasn’t sure.) was turned on its side. On top
of a refrigerator, a globe was balanced precariously, teetering on the
edge. Alongside all the other miscellaneous items, there was also a vast
assortment of clothes, ranging in style from those weird Tuxedo shirts
Luz had seen people wear to prom all the way to what appeared to be a
hand-knit sweater that looked like it had been stolen out of a nursing
home.</p>
<p>“What the fizzlesitcks?” This place was weird.</p>
<p>Then, Luz took a sniff. The air smelled... odd. Like someone had
managed to combine the scent of ozone and <em>maduros</em> into one
smell. It was both sweet and off-putting at the same time. Luz didn’t
even know a smell like that was possible. The worst part was that that
was the only thing Luz could smell, as if every other scent had been
overpowered by the <em>madurozone</em> smell.</p>
<p>She also felt hungry for some reason. But that was silly, because she
had just had that oatmeal about an hour ago. She pushed that thought
aside. She had to focus on getting her backpack back from the Owl
Thief.</p>
<p>“Finally, you’re back.” Luz did her best not scream at the sudden
noise and quickly hid behind a nearby overturned couch. She cautiously
peeked her head over the couch to see who the new voice belonged to.</p>
<p>The first thing Luz noticed was the giant shock of gray hair the
person had, falling all the way down their back. The person was wearing
a bright red dress and had a green-and-white dotted bandana covering
their ears. Their skin was an incredibly pale shade of white, and they
were T A L L, towering over Luz, even while they were bending over.</p>
<p>Alongside Mystery Person was Owl Thief, backpack in talon. The owl
dropped Luz’s bag on a table and then rested on Mystery Person’s staff
before MP started <em>screwing the owl into the staff</em> and the owl
<em>turned to wood</em>.</p>
<p>Luz’s jaw dropped to the floor so fast it nearly broke the laws of
gravity.</p>
<p>“Now let’s see what you’ve brought back,” MP said, as if they didn’t
just do something Luz thought impossible. MP opened Luz’s backpack and
began rummaging around in it, pulling out items and seeming to appraise
them, before eventually putting them all back in and zipping the bag
shut.</p>
<p>“Really, Owlbert? I can’t even sell any of this. As far as I’m
concerned, this is all just garbage or kindling,” MP said to the owl...
staff... thingy. Luz wasn’t sure what to call it.</p>
<p><em>The Good Witch Azura is NOT kindling!</em> Luz thought. She
couldn’t stand it anymore. Luz ran out from her hiding spot behind the
couch, quickly grabbed her backpack with a “That’s mine, thank you very
much.”, and made a mad dash for the still open glowing white portal.</p>
<p>Only for it to close and fold up into a briefcase before
disappearing.</p>
<p>“You’re not getting away that easy.” Luz turned around to see MP
holding up a key. The key was wooden and had a button with an eye-shaped
symbol on it. If Luz wasn’t currently panicking for her life, she
probably would have remarked on the ornate designs and delicate
craftsmanship of the key. But now was not the time for that.</p>
<p>Luz screamed before turning back around and escaping out the back of
the tent by lifting up the canvas and scrambling under it and through to
the outside world, finding herself on a cliff face overlooking a
town.</p>
<p>And what a town it was. Giant hands were erupting from the ground,
houses covering them like a bastardized skyscraper. Even larger bones,
looking to be a rib cage of some kind, pierced the heavens like a
protective border around the town. And the teeth. There were. So. Many.
TEETH.</p>
<p>There was no way Luz was still on Earth.</p>
<p>A fairy approached her. She screamed, before lowering her defenses at
the tiny creature.</p>
<p>“Oh. Hi there, little fairy. Are you here to tell me that this is all
a magical dream and that I’m going to wake up in a few minutes?”</p>
<p>“GIVE ME YOUR SKIN!”</p>
<p>Luz screamed, louder this time, and slapped the fairy out of the sky.
Catching a brief glance at her hands, her vitiligo markings were
definitely larger then normal, and no amount of blinking made them
shrink back to their normal size.</p>
<p>“What is this place? Is this the underworld?” Luz questioned
herself.</p>
<p>“You wish.” MP said, clapping a hand on Luz’s shoulder, before
effortlessly scooping Luz up and carrying her over their shoulder. They
then carried Luz back through the tent and sat her down on a stool in
front of their stand of “Human Collectibles”.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry! I just wanted my bag back!” Luz slammed her eyes shut,
dreading what would happen next, “If you’re going to eat my skin, just
do it now!”</p>
<p>MP chuckled. “Eat you? Why would I eat a potential customer?”</p>
<p>Luz slowly opened her eyes. <em>What?</em>, she thought.</p>
<p>MP then began bombarding her with item after item, all from Earth,
and all had their purpose horribly misconstrued. A floor lamp was a
“close combat practice dummy”, a glowing blue box was a “paperweight
that can hold anything down”, and a miniature radio missing its
batteries was a “snail display device”.</p>
<p>Luz giggled at the last one.</p>
<p>“It can do more than just that. Watch this.” She grabbed some
batteries from a bowl labeled <em>Human Candy! (???)</em> and quickly
popped them in to the radio. Turning it on and tuning in to one of her
favorite stations, Luz let the radio work its magic.</p>
<p>It worked immediately, drawing a large crowd to the stand, all of
whom were vying for possession of the wonderous music making machine. An
impromptu bidding war began amongst the shoppers, with one even
inquiring if they would be able to “eat the tiny person trapped in the
box.”</p>
<p>MP smiled at the sudden influx of popularity in their stand. “What
did you say your name was?”</p>
<p>“Oh. I’m Luz. Luz Noceda.”</p>
<p>MP began grabbing all the money they could from anyone in arm’s
reach. “Well, Luz. I have to say that that was very clever, especially
for a human.”</p>
<p>Luz raised a eyebrow at that statement. “That’s pretty weird for a
human to say.”</p>
<p>MP smirked. “Oh, dear child, I am not like you.” They ripped off
their bandana to reveal long, pointed ears. Luz’s mind instantly went to
the Elven race from <em>Creatures &amp; Caverns</em>.</p>
<p>MP then climbed on top of the table and continued their introduction.
“I’m Eda the Owl Lady.” <em>Huh, that’s a unique moniker.</em> “I am the
most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles.” <em>Okay, not an elf, but a
witch</em>.</p>
<p>“Woah.” That was all Luz could get out before Eda continued her
spiel.</p>
<p>“I am respected across the lands, feared for my prowess in wild
magic, and I am —”</p>
<p>“BUSTED!” A gloved fist smashed the radio mid-song, causing the crowd
to scamper, with cries of “Run, it’s a guard!” echoing across the
marketplace.</p>
<p>“Eda the Owl Lady, you are wanted for usage of wild magic and refusal
to join a coven.” The guard held up Eda’s wanted poster.</p>
<p>The poster proclaimed that “Eda the Owl Lady” was to be captured, and
whoever brought her in would receive a reward of 1 trillion snails.
Alongside Eda and Owlbert, a third figure was also shown. The creature
looked like a dog with a skull on its head. <em>Maybe that’s another one
of her pets?</em> Luz questioned.</p>
<p>“You are hereby ordered to come with me to the Conformatorium.” The
guard grabbed Eda’s arm, but she yanked it away.</p>
<p>“Would you chumps quit stalking me? I haven’t done anything,” Eda
retorted, crossing her arms in defiance.</p>
<p>“You’re coming too, for associating with a known criminal.” the guard
said, yanking Luz into the air by her hood.</p>
<p>“What! I didn’t know!” Luz yelped.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright. You win. Just put the kid down and let me pack up
my stuff.” Eda said, before grabbing Owlbert and whacking the guard in
the temple. The guard collapsed to the ground with a grunt. Eda then
tapped her staff against the table, and the entire stand wrapped itself
up in to a neat little knapsack. She then pulled out the key from before
and pressed its button, resulting in the briefcase disappearing into the
ether.</p>
<p>Sticking the key into her hair, Eda grabbed Luz’s arm and dragged the
girl behind her, running from the downed guard.</p>
<p>“Come on, human. Let’s ditch these fools.”</p>
<p>“This is insane! If I die here, my mom will become a mess.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, human. You’re much more valuable to me alive than
dead.”</p>
<p>“Wait, what’s that supposed to —” Luz was cut off by Eda jumping up
and pulling her onto Owlbert, the group taking flight.</p>
<p>Luz looked down at where she just was to see the guard chase after
them, only to stop when they realized their target had escaped. They
looked like they said something before hanging their head in shame and
walking away defeated.</p>
<p>Luz then realized that she was flying. On a magic stick. With no
safety measures. She rightfully let out a small scream and clamped on to
the wood with a death grip that made her knuckles white.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a giant twelve-winged bird with a razor sharp beak flew by,
the wingtips brushing against Luz’s back. Eda picked Luz up and righted
her on the staff.</p>
<p>“<em>¡Dios mío!</em> What is this place?” This <em>definitely</em> ws
not Earth, Luz concluded.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the Boiling Isles, where anything and everything can and
will try to kill you,” Eda explained.</p>
<p>“What other monsters are there?”</p>
<p>“Well, you’ve already met the annoying buggers that are fairies, but
there are also griffins, vampires, giraffes...” Eda listed off.</p>
<p>“Hold on, giraffes?” Luz looked dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Bunch of witch-eating freaks. Don’t worry, though. We banished
‘em to the Human Realm.” Eda shuddered slightly. One of her old
classmates, Perry, had lost his wife to a wild giraffe attack.</p>
<p>Eda landed the staff, and Luz quickly hopped off, happy to be back on
solid ground. Eda dismounted as well, but her hand was left behind. Luz
saw the detached hand wiggle, independent of its owner, and she
screamed.</p>
<p>“Oops. Sorry about that kid. Forgot to tell you that that happens
sometimes.” Eda said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve had enough of this isekai, and this realm is not the ages
6-11 TV show I expected. So, can you let me use your portal thingy and
go back home?” Luz said, only for Eda to point Owlbert at her.</p>
<p>“Now hold on just a minute. I’ll let you go home if you help me
first. Come on, human.” Eda began walking away, and Luz was quick to
follow.</p>
<p>The two stopped in front of a cottage with an attached stone tower.
The cottage section had a large stained-glass window in the shape of an
eye over the front door. Speaking of that door, there was an incredibly
realistic carving of the face of an owl. It kinda freaked Luz out.</p>
<p>Luz looked over her shoulder. “Aren’t you worried that those guards
could have followed us?”</p>
<p>“Not in the slightest. My house has a cutting edge defense system.”
Eda confidently said.</p>
<p>“Hoot hoot! What’s the password?” The owl face on the door was
actually talking. This world never stopped surprising Luz.</p>
<p>Eda poked the owl... door... thing in the eyes. “Can it, Hooty. Just
let us in.”</p>
<p>“All right, all right. Jees. Do you all hate having fun or something?
Ow! Hoot!” Hooty then opened his maw, expanding to fill the entire
doorframe. Luz and Eda stepped through the doorway, before Hooty
returned to normal and let out a belch.</p>
<p>“Welcome to... the Owl House.”</p>
<p><strong>10 Minutes Prior</strong></p>
<p>Number Five was tired of running. She adjusted her cowl, tightening
it up, and began to survey the marketplace. There weren’t any unattended
stands. Oh Titan, this wasn’t going to be easy. Guards would be crawling
all over the place.</p>
<p>Five noticed that an oddly large crowd was gathering around a stand.
They walked over to investigate. Music, or something like it, was being
emitted from an odd-looking box. A tall witch with a red dress was
grabbing handfuls of snails from the onlookers vying for the box and
a... Hold on. Was that a human standing next to the witch? How did one
of those get here? Five looked around, and noticed that a portal was
open inside the witch’s tent. Ahh, that’s how.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a guard smashed the music box. The guard was apparently
trying to arrest the witch for some crime. Five didn’t hear what for
though, because she was too busy looking for a place to hide. Not
finding anywhere that would work, Five snuck into the witch’s tent,
ditched her cloak, and went through the portal without a second thought.
Wherever she ended up would be better than here.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, May 22, 2021 | 9:22 A.M. | The Woods of
Gravesfield, Connecticut</strong></p>
<p>Camila was running out of options. She had checked the entire house
and had also asked the Berenson’s if they had seen Luz. No luck. Then,
an idea struck her. Camila had always told Luz to stay away from the old
abandoned house in the woods. Luz had to be there. She just had to.</p>
<p>Beginning her trek into the woods, Camila tried to remember the exact
path to the rundown building. Turning left after walking passed the
large granite chunk embedded in a tree, and then following the stream,
she found herself in front of the house.</p>
<p>And Luz was there.</p>
<p>“Hello, fellow human. Skin sure is weird.” Camila chuckled as Luz
stretched the skin of her elbow.</p>
<p>“Oh <em>cariño</em>, you had me so worried. I’m just glad you’re
okay.” Camila said, giving Luz a tight hug.</p>
<p>“Alright, since the bus is nowhere to be seen, how about we drive to
camp instead of waiting? I’ll give you full control of the playlist once
we hit the interstate. How does that sound?”</p>
<p>“That, uh, sounds great,” Luz said, even though she looked confused
for some reason.</p>
<p>Camila smiled, and the two packed the car up and drove off to
camp.</p>
<h1 id="luz-goes-through-her-mid-teens-crisis">Luz Goes Through Her
Mid-Teens Crisis</h1>
<p><strong>Kaufetag 2, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Luz gasped. “This place is beautiful!”</p>
<p>The living room floor was mostly barren, save for two old (but comfy
looking) couches and a wooden coffee table. The walls were much more
lively, though. The wall behind the large, maroon couch was covered in
random objects. Luz could make out an axe, foam finger, and a
disembodied hand, all hanging on the wall, among countless other
oddities. The main focal point for that wall, though, was a huge framed
version of the wanted poster Luz had seen earlier. On the ceiling, a
ginormous caricature of an owl could be seen, outlined in a yellow
flame. A few chests laid sealed shut by the door, while an extravagant
fireplace and numerous candles provided lighting for the room, casting a
slight orange hue over everything.</p>
<p>Luz laid her backpack down, resting it against the coffee table and
letting her shoulders relax.</p>
<p>“So, do you live here by yourself, or?” Luz questioned.</p>
<p>“Actually, I have a roommate. Last I checked, he was napping though.”
Eda responded.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a loud <em><strong>THUD</strong></em> echoed through the
building.</p>
<p>“Not anymore, it seems.”</p>
<p>“Who dares awaken the King of Demons from his slumber?” Luz turned to
see the cutest thing she had ever seen. Even cuter then the Hecazura
fanart that acted as her phone’s wallpaper, hard as that may be.
Standing in the hallway was a creature Luz had never encountered before.
His body was similar to that of a dog, with black fur, a gray
underbelly, with his tail being tipped in a similar color. A red collar
with a gold tag on it was wrapped around his neck. Instead of dog paws,
he had claws that were bone white, and his head appeared to be a skull
with two horns protruding from the top, one of them missing a sizable
chunk off the top. The cutest part, though, was his outfit. He wore a
small navy blue nightcap, complete with a tiny yellow tassel hanging off
the edge, and he dragged a light bleu blanket behind him, Luz couldn’t
help but be reminded of that one character from <em>Legumes</em>.
(<em>What was that character’s name? Lincoln?</em> Luz thought.) His
pink eyes with yellow sclera met Luz’s hazel.</p>
<p>“<em>¡Eres tan lindo!</em>” Luz ran over and wrapped the small
creature up in a tight hug and spun around, sending the nightcap and
blanket flying. “Eda, he’s adorable! Who’s a little cutie? Who’s a
little cutie? Is it you? Is it you?”</p>
<p>King gave a valiant effort to escape Luz’s grasp, but it failed. “No!
I don’t know who your little cutie is! Eda, free me from this
monster!”</p>
<p>Eda then snatched Luz, dragging her away from King. “’This monster’
is Luz, a human. She’s here to help us with our... situation.”</p>
<p>“Really? Great!” King exclaimed.</p>
<p>Luz looked up at Eda, still stuck in the witch’s grasp. “Hold on.
What do you mean by ‘situation’?”</p>
<p>Eda sighed and let Luz down. “How should I explain this? King here
was once the mighty King of Demons, ruling over his subjects with an
iron fist and defeating countless enemies in battle, squashing them if
they ever challenged his throne. But one day, his Crown of Power was
stolen, and he turned into what you see today.”</p>
<p>“You mean this little sweetie.” Luz interjected, giving King another
tight hug.</p>
<p>“The Crown is held under lock and key by the notorious Warden Wrath,
trapped behind a nigh-impenetrable force field that only a human can
break through. A human like you.”</p>
<p>Eda looked at Luz, gauging her reaction. The girl had a mix of wonder
and intrigue painted on her face.</p>
<p>“I’ll make a deal with ya, kid. If you help us get King’s crown back,
you’ll get a one-way ticket through the portal back to the Human Realm.
Plus, who could say no to this little angel?” Eda picked up King and
gently shook him to drive home the point.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Don’t encourage this!” King yelled, before Eda dropped him to
the floor.</p>
<p>“Look, kid. We need you right now. If you want to go home, you’ll
have to do us a favor first,” Eda stated.</p>
<p>“So I’m guessing this is my only option?” Luz said glumly.</p>
<p>“Yup, now come on. We have to hurry.” Eda said, picking Luz up and
throwing her over her shoulder, quickly walking out the door.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget about me!” King said, chasing after them.</p>
<p>“Where exactly are we going to get King’s crown?” Luz thought aloud
as the group mounted Owlbert.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, kid. It’ll be a blast.” Eda said.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the Conformatorium, where the quote unquote ‘unsuitables
of society’ are locked away. Or, as I call them, ‘like-minded
individuals’.” Eda hopped off Owlbert, before the others followed suit.
The flight over had been relatively quick, but the weather had decided
to take a turn for the worse, with the sunny skies giving way to muggy,
gray clouds and the occasional bolt of lightning and clap of thunder.
Luckily, though, there was no accompanying boiling rains.</p>
<p>During the trip from the Owl House to the Conformatorium, Luz had
noticed that the odd hunger in her stomach was back. She probably just
needed a snack or something to soothe the rumblings, so she ignored it.
Food could wait. They were on a mission!</p>
<p>“Woah, they’ve got your face plastered everywhere.” Luz observed,
ripping one of Eda’s wanted posters of a wall. She haphazardly stuck the
poster in her back pocket.</p>
<p>“Yup, but we still haven’t been caught cause we’re so slick,” Eda
said with a grin.</p>
<p>“Try to catch me when I’m covered in grease. I’m a squirmy little
fella.” King said from atop Luz’s head, before promptly falling off and
landing on the dirt with an <em>oof</em>.</p>
<p>“So what exactly is our plan to get King his crown back?” Luz
inquired.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty simple: you and King are going to sneak up to the top of
the tower and get his crowm from behind the force field, while I’ll keep
the warden distracted.” Eda explained.</p>
<p>“Wait, does that mean we’ll need disguises?” Luz gasped, “I have the
perfect idea then.” Pulling her hood up, and flicking the sewed-on cat
ears up, she let out a “Meow, meow!”</p>
<p>“That’s disgusting.” King remarked.</p>
<p>“You look like a <em>bona fide</em> weirdo. Good thinkin’, kid.” Eda
chimed in.</p>
<p>Eda then slammed the butt of her staff against the ground. A glowing
circular platform appeared under Luz and King’s feet and it began to
rise.</p>
<p>“Don’t fall off and I’ll meet you at the Contraband area.” Eda said
before hopping on Owlbert and flying off to another part of the
prison.</p>
<p>The platform quickly rose up the side of the tower until it reached
an opening that both King and Luz could fit through.</p>
<p>Acting quickly, Luz jumped off the platform and scrambled to find
purchase on the ledge. King, meanwhile, jumped onto Luz and climbed on
and over her until he was inside the building, grunting the entire time.
Luz then barely managed to pull herself over the ledge and in, only to
fall face first onto the floor.</p>
<p>As she recomposed herself and brushed the dirt and cobwebs from her
face and hair, King chuckled at her misfortune. “Haha. You’re not a real
cat.”</p>
<p>Just before Luz was about to snark back at the dog-creature, a new
voice interrupted the two. “Hey, cat lady, how did you escape?”</p>
<p>Luz turned to find where the voice was coming from and found herself
face-to-face with a prisoner. The witch in question had their black hair
tied up in a ponytail and were wearing a simple indigo dress and a gold
band around their neck with a pair of black, heeled boots to finish the
ensemble.</p>
<p>“I’m not a cat, and I’m not a criminal.” Luz pulled down her hood,
revealing her actual ears.</p>
<p>“You’ll probably be one soon, though.” King said.</p>
<p>“We aren’t, either. The warden just locks up anyone who doesn’t agree
with the emperor or does something he doesn’t like. Like, I write
fanfics about food falling in love. Everyone likes food, and everyone
likes love, so just combine the two. But no. The emperor doesn’t like
lemons, so off to jail I go,” The witch proclaimed.</p>
<p>“I’m here because I eat my eyes.” Another prisoner said, and to
emphasize their point, they ate one of their own eyes, only for it to
reappear in its socket a second later.</p>
<p>“We are agents of chaos! We speak the twuth!” A third prisoner
said.</p>
<p>“Ugh, don’t listen to her. She’s watched way too many conspiracy
theories on the CB.” The first prisoner interjected.</p>
<p>“The world is actually a stowy, and we are but chawacters in it!” The
other continued.</p>
<p>Luz paced back and forth, debating with herself, before finlly coming
to a decision.</p>
<p>“None of these are actually crimes. Sure, they are a little... odd,
but you aren’t hurting anyone. You especially haven’t done anything
worth prison.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, loud footsteps began echoing through the chamber.</p>
<p>“Oh crud, it’s the warden. Quick, hide!”</p>
<p>Luz quickly ran into an empty cell, King in close pursuit, and
slammed the gate shut. Outside the cell, Eda’s wanted poster had fallen
out of Luz’s pocket and came to a rest on the floor.</p>
<p>A door that Luz hadn’t noticed previously opened, and out stepped the
warden.</p>
<p>“Do you fools think I’m deaf?”</p>
<p>Luz whimpered, moving to make herself as small as possible in the
back corner of the cell. Unbeknownst to her, her spots on her hands were
larger than they had ever been, nearly covering her entire palm.</p>
<p>“What are you scum talking about?”</p>
<p>Warden Wrath stomped his way over to the cell Luz and King were in
before grabbing the wanted poster off the ground.</p>
<p>“Ahh. The Owl Lady.”</p>
<p>The warden then moprhed his hand into a hammer, completely
encompassing the poster, before slamming it into the gate of the
cell.</p>
<p>“She’ll be in a cell soon enough.”</p>
<p>The warden turned to look at Luz. She pressed herself even further
into the corner, feeling the cold, rough bricks rubbing against her
skin. Luz slammed her eyes shut, saying a silent prayer that the warden
wouldn’t notice that she was an intruder. What Luz didn’t notice,
however, was that the eyelids she had closed had done so horizontally,
instead of vertically.</p>
<p>“Fwee us, you tywant. You can never siwence us. The twuth will be
heard.”</p>
<p>Luz slowly opened her eyes to see the warden opening the cell
belonging to the conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>“Hooway, fweedom at wast!”</p>
<p>Only for the warden to wrap his hand around the prisoner’s entire
body and squeeze tightly.</p>
<p>“If I ever hear a word from any of you ever again, expect solitary
confinement for the rest of your miserable little lives.”</p>
<p>With that last warning, the warden stomped off, conspiracy theorist
in hand, and closed the door.</p>
<p>Luz slowly crawled back to the front of the cell, and checked to make
sure the warden was really gone. After confirming that, she slowly
lifted the gate and crawled out, King following close behind.</p>
<p>Luz ran over to the witch prisoner’s cell.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll get you guys out.” With all her might, Luz tried
to lift the handle controlling the cell gate. It didn’t budge.</p>
<p>“Curse my weak noodle arms.” Luz said, defeated.</p>
<p>“Hey, kid. You’re free. Enjoy it, even if we can’t.” The prisoner
said, retreating into the darkness of their cell and sliding to the
ground.</p>
<p>Luz despondently walked away, picking King up and holding him under
her arm.</p>
<p>Eventually, Luz found a long hallway that was deserted and sat down,
stewing in the despair that she couldn’t help those poor prisoners.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Eda flew up to the two before getting off Owlbert.</p>
<p>“Hey. Just checked on Wrath, and he’s preoccupied torturing some tiny
nose creature. He won’t bother us for a while. Let’s find King’s crown
and skedaddle.”</p>
<p>Wordlessly, Luz got up and began walking down the hall, only to find
herself in front of a gigantic door with the word “CONTRABAND”
emblzaoned on it.</p>
<p>“My crown. I can sense it. It has to be nearby.” King ran up to the
door and began fiddling with the knob, trying to force the door
open.</p>
<p>Eda chuckled. “He’s adorable when power gets to his head.”</p>
<p>Luz felt a small smile on her face. Yeah, that is pretty cute.</p>
<p>King grunted as he threw the doorknob behind him. Apparently, he had
broken the entire lock. Forcing the door open, King made his way into
the contraband holding area.</p>
<p>“Come on, let’s follow him before he blows something up.” With that,
Eda and Luz followed the dog-demon.</p>
<p>The room wasn’t exactly what Luz expected. She thought the magical
force field would be like an invisible wall, separating the items and
everyone else. Instead, the force field was an opaque blue-ish white
cylinder in the center of the room. Outside the cylinder, a small box
was toppled over, spilling objects onto the floor.</p>
<p>“Give me my crown!” King yelled as he ran head first into the force
field, only to be sent flying back.</p>
<p>“Hey genius, we have a human remember?” Eda said, prompting King’s
memory.</p>
<p>“Oh, right.” King responded.</p>
<p>Approaching the cylinder, Luz took a deep breath and pressed her hand
against it, expecting to feel some odd sensation as her hand passes
straight through.</p>
<p>It didn’t.</p>
<p>Luz’s hand was planted firmly against the force field.</p>
<p>Trying again, Luz backed up and walked forward, only to walk into a
wall of magic.</p>
<p>She tried again to no avail.</p>
<p>“Eda, are you sure humans can pass through?”</p>
<p>“Pretty sure, kid.”</p>
<p>“<em>Mierda</em>.” Luz hoped <em>mamá</em> wasn’t somehow listening
in, or there would be a meeting between a bar of soap and her mouth when
she got back home.</p>
<p>Luz tried a fourth time to pass through the barrier, and got pushed
back all the same.</p>
<p>After that last failed attempt, Luz was beginning to freak out.</p>
<p>Maybe she had to say some password.</p>
<p>“Klaatu barada nikto.” Nothing.</p>
<p>“Open sesame.” No change.</p>
<p>“Please open.” Once again, no response.</p>
<p>Luz began fervently pacing back and forth.</p>
<p>She was human, right?</p>
<p>She had to be. She wasn’t a centaur. She didn’t have blue skin, or an
extra set of eyes growing out of her forehead, or a tail.</p>
<p>She had to be human.</p>
<p>She had to.</p>
<p>“Hey Luz, do humans normally grow scales on their arms when they’re
stressed?” King’s voice broke through.</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>Luz stopped pacing and looked down at her right arm, only to see that
her entire forearm was covered in brown and white scales. Rotating her
arm slowly, they glistened in the soft torchlight that illuminated the
room.</p>
<p>Luz blinked, trying to make the scales go away. As she did so, she
noticed that her eyelids were moving left-right, instead of the normal
up-down motion she was used to.</p>
<p>What was wrong with her?</p>
<p>She looked at her left arm, and the same brown and white scales were
popping up there, too.</p>
<p>Then, Luz felt her ears change. Reaching up to where her ears used to
be, she instead felt fur-like hair and leathery skin.</p>
<p>Entering full on panic mode, Luz tried to run over to Eda, only to
find her that legs were fusing together, forming into a tail. Falling to
the ground, Luz felt the panic overtake her as she felt even more
changes wrack her body.</p>
<p>Her hair that was normally cut short grew long, extending down her
back.</p>
<p>Her nose flattened and rounded out, looking more like it belonged on
a pug than a person.</p>
<p>Her teeth sharpened, being replaced entirely with canines.</p>
<p>Her hands became unrecognizable, with her fingernails morphing into
claws and the fingers themselves growing long and spindly.</p>
<p>Her insides weren’t safe, either, as she felt what felt like a second
stomach grow out of nothing, and her entire digestive system got
completely messed up.</p>
<p>As fast as the changes had began, they stopped.</p>
<p>Luz began taking slow, shallow breaths.</p>
<p>What had just happened?</p>
<p>Luz peered up at Eda and King to see their faces staring back at hers
with a look of horror.</p>
<p>“WHAT IN THE NAME OF THE TITAN?” Eda broke the silence.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I swear Miss Eda, I have no idea what’s going on.” Luz
said, feeling lucky that she ould still talk.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay. Let’s just think this through. So, you’ve always been a
human.” Eda began.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“But then you got spooked because you coudn’t go through the
humans-only force field, and turned into a... whatever you are right
now.”</p>
<p>“Uh huh.”</p>
<p>“Has this ever happened before when you got scared or anxious?”</p>
<p>“Not that I can think of.”</p>
<p>“Can you think of any way to turn yourself back into a human? Maybe
try picturing yourself that way. See what happens.”</p>
<p>Luz closed her eyes, and concentrated.</p>
<p>She wanted to be human again.</p>
<p>She wanted her two legs back.</p>
<p>She wanted her hair to be normal.</p>
<p>She wanted fingernails and short, stubby fingers.</p>
<p>She wanted a pointy nose and blocky teeth.</p>
<p>She wanted her body back.</p>
<p>Opening her eyes, Luz was still a demon.</p>
<p>“Dang it,” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Hmm. Well that ain’t good,” Eda said. She swore she had seen a
creature that looked like Luz before, in one of her old cryptozoology
books that she had studied as a kid. What was it, though?</p>
<p>Breaking the silence, both of Luz’s stomachs decided to loudly
rumble.</p>
<p>“Miss Eda, I know this is an odd question, but do you have any food
on you?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“That’s it!” Eda shouted, seemingly ignoring Luz’s request, “You’re a
basilisk! I knew I’d seen it somwehere.”</p>
<p>Her celebration was short-lived though, as Warden Wrath appeared
behind her, and sliced off her head in one swift move. Her head rolled
to a stop in front of Luz.</p>
<p>Luz screamed, thinking she had just witnessed a murder, only for Eda
to keep on talking.</p>
<p>“What the hell. You can’t let me celebrate for five seconds?” She
complained.</p>
<p>Wrath walked over and picked up Eda’s head, bringing it to eye
level.</p>
<p>“Eda the Owl Lady. I’ve finally captured you.”</p>
<p>Luz scanned her surroundings. It was just the four of them, no guards
in sight. Good. That would make this much easier.</p>
<p>“I knew your pet couldn’t live without his toy, and he brought you
right to me.”</p>
<p>Luz tried lifting her tail, and found that it had some significant
heft behind it. She was still hungry, too. And it wasn’t for food, she
realised. It was for something else. A plan quickly formulated itself in
her mind.</p>
<p>“But I’m not here to be your captor. I am here with a
proposition.”</p>
<p>It was now or never.</p>
<p>“LET MISS EDA GO!”</p>
<p>Swinging her body around and using her tail like a baseball bat, Luz
swatted at Eda’s head and sent it flying. With the warden distracted by
the now flying head, Luz quickly righted herself and faced Wrath.
Opening her jaw as far as it could go, she began to
<em><strong>CONSUME</strong></em>. She wasn’t sure how she knew what to
do, but she did. It was like second nature for her. She felt her
stomachs begin to fill as she drained more and more magic from the
warden. His magic had an interesting taste, she noted, like a mix of
grape juice and honey, with the viscosity to match.</p>
<p>Wrath first wavered back and forth, before falling to one knee as he
grew weaker, and then finally collapsed to the ground face-first, his
skin now a pale shade of gray instead of its normal purple hue.</p>
<p>Luz slithered over (That was weird for her to say.) and pressed two
long fingers against the warden’s neck. She hoped the warden’s anatomy
was similar to that of a humans. She felt a pulse, albeit a weak one.
Good. She may have been an unholy abomination, but at least she wasn’t a
murderer.</p>
<p>She then went and picked Eda’s head up and handed it over to its
owner’s wandering body.</p>
<p>After screwing her head back on, Eda gave Luz a smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what the hell you just did, but thanks kid. Now let’s
get out of here before Warden Wartface wakes up.”</p>
<p>Luz reciprocated the smile as best she could, even though hers
probably made it look like she wanted to eat someone’s baby. It was the
thought that counts.</p>
<p>As the trio made their way out of the contraband room, King noticed
something sticking out of the box that was laying outside the force
field. Dashing over, he pulled out a stuffed rabbit with buttons for
eyes. Letting out a giggle, he tapped the rabbit on the shoulder three
times while proclaiming, “I dub thee Francois, and you shall serve as
the second-in-command in my Army of Darkness.”</p>
<p>Returning to the group with a shout of, “I have a minion now!”, King
scampered his way up to rest on Eda’s shoulder.</p>
<p>The group then swiftly made their way back to the main holding cells.
They encountered a few guards along the way, but it wasn’t anything a
quick whack to the back of the head with Owlbert couldn’t solve. It was
right then that Eda had a wonderful, devious idea.</p>
<p>As Luz and Eda combined to free all of the prisoners in the
Conformatorium, they noticed that three of them were staying behind at
the front door.</p>
<p>Flying down, the three staying behind were the three prisoners that
Luz had met earlier.</p>
<p>The fanfic writer approached them first.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Owl Lady and co. If you ever need any help, don’t be afraid
to ask. Oh, and my name’s Katya, by the way.”</p>
<p>Katya then left, flying away on her palisman.</p>
<p>The eye eater was next, walking away with a simple, “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Finally, there was the conspiracy theorist, who ran off quickly after
saying, “May the authow show mawcy on your souw.”</p>
<p>Luz slithered through the front door of the Owl House, not even
bothering to humor Hooty, and promptly collapsed onto the couch. While
the flight to the Conformatorium had been easy as a human, the flight
back was not as easy, as she had to wrap her tail around Owlbert
multiple times and gripping tightly with both hands to keep herself from
falling off, which was not a fun task.</p>
<p>As she felt herself sink into the worn-out cushions, Luz heard her
phone’s text alert go off, with the specific chime indicating that it
was from <em>Mamá</em>. Letting out a sigh, she dug through her bag to
retrieve the guilty device, only to find that her scaley fingers weren’t
working on the touchscreen. Cursing silently, she put her phone back
down. This was a conundrum.</p>
<p>Eda decided to make her presence known by barging into the living
room from the basement, an old book held high in the air with both
hands.</p>
<p>“FOUND IT!” She yelled.</p>
<p>“Found what?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“My old cryptozoology study book.” Eda answered.</p>
<p>“Oh yay.” Luz said, eyes closing slowly as she struggled to stay
awake. “Can we read it in the morning though? I’m super tired.”</p>
<p>“Totally, kid. I’ll leave it on the kitchen table for when you wake
up,” Eda said, placing the book right where she said she would, before
going upstairs.</p>
<p>“Thanks...” Luz slurred out as Eda went up the steps. The couch was
really comfortable, and woud be a nice spot to sleep.</p>
<p>“No problem, kid. Have a good night.”</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, May 22, 2021, 10:19 PM | Reality Check Summer Camp
| Hoboken, New Jersey</strong></p>
<p>Number Five sighed and collapsed onto her bed. Today had been
stressful. She’d had to go the entire day in the <del>Lus</del> Luz
disguise, something she had never done before. Before today, the longest
she’d kept a morph on was only about two hours, but now she’d had to do
it for over twelve. It really tested her willpower, because if she was
scared or surprised hard enough, then she could accidentally drop the
disguise, outing her as a demon to everyone who saw. That could not
happen.</p>
<p>Another thing that Five realised was that the Human Realm had no
magic in it whatsoever, and that she was running dangerously low on
magic as well, so she was essentially stuck in this form for the time
being.</p>
<p>She stared at the bottom of the bed hanging a few feet above her. The
frame was in clear need of some fixing, but she doubted the camp cared,
based on the similar state of disrepair of the other buildings she had
been in today.</p>
<p>This camp was not at all what Camila had described it as during the
car ride over.</p>
<p>Five let out another long sigh, drawing the attention of Masha, who
stuck their head down from the bunk bed above.</p>
<p>“You alright, Luz?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, yeah I’m fine. Just... thinking, ya know?”</p>
<p>“Whatcha thinkin’ about?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Camp. Life. Stuff like that.”</p>
<p>“Wanna talk about it?”</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>“Alright. If you ever do want to talk about it, though, I’ll always
be open. Same probably goes for Jake and Marco, wherever they are.”</p>
<p>“Where are those two, anyway? Wasn’t lights out supposed to be at
10?”</p>
<p>“I dunno. They’re probably playing a prank on Counselor Chapman or
something.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, probably. Well, I’m really tired, so I’m gonna go to sleep.
Night, Masha.”</p>
<p>“Night, Luz.”</p>
<h1 id="luz-reads-a-book">Luz Reads A Book</h1>
<p><strong>Schlaftag 2, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Luz slowly opened her eyes. Her eyelids moved left-right. Looking
down at her arm, she saw it was still covered in those cursed brown
scales.</p>
<p>“So it wasn’t a dream. Great.”</p>
<p>Letting out a sigh, she wormed her way off the couch and onto the
floor. Looking back at the cushions, she noticed that she had apparently
shed a few scales while she was asleep. Hopefully Miss Eda wouldn’t be
too mad Luz got her couch dirty.</p>
<p>Slithering into the kitchen, Luz let out a loud yawn.</p>
<p>She needed some food.</p>
<p>And coffee.</p>
<p>Lots of coffee.</p>
<p>Hopefully that existed here.</p>
<p>Opening the fridge, Luz then realized that she would have no idea how
to cook anything here. It didn’t help that she didn’t recognize anything
that looked edible. Eyeballs and a weird yellow goop were definitely not
her first choice for breakfast. She did see a giant jug of something
called “Apple Blood”, so maybe It was this realm’s version of apple
juice. That might be palatable.</p>
<p>Grabbing the jug and uncorking it, Luz gave the drink a quick
sniff.</p>
<p>It smelled like iron. And it was a S T R O N G smell.</p>
<p>Nope. Back in the fridge it goes.</p>
<p>Just as Luz was about to put the drink away, she heard a shout of
“Hey! Hands off my apple blood!”</p>
<p>Quickly stuffing the jug back in the fridge and slamming the door
shut, Luz turned to see Eda walking down the stairs with an angry look
on her face.</p>
<p>“King, how many times do I have to tell... Wait. You aren’t King. Who
are you again?” Eda said, picking at her ear and flicking away a stray
spider.</p>
<p>For some reason, Luz really wanted to eat that spider. But she
didn’t, because that would be rude and weird.</p>
<p>“I’m Luz. The weird human-basilisk thing. We staged a prison riot
last night. Any of that ring a bell?”</p>
<p>“Look, kid. I’m just gonna need you to repeat all that after I’ve had
my apple blood, okay?”</p>
<p>True to her word, Eda grabbed a mug from one of the overhead
cupboards, filled it to the brim with apple blood, and drank it all in
one fell swoop.</p>
<p>King then walked down the stairs. Not acknowledging the others, he
simply opened the fridge, grabbed the eyeballs and that strange yellow
goop, threw them together on a plate, and started stabbing at it with a
fork.</p>
<p>“Is he okay?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah he’s fine. Just isn’t very talkative right when he wakes up.
Give him a few minutes and he’ll start shouting orders,” Eda replied
before she grabbed a burlap sack and started placing potions and bottles
in it.</p>
<p>After watching her gather supplies for a few minutes, Luz slithered
over and tapped Eda on the back.</p>
<p>“So, Miss Eda, are we going to be doing anything today?” A blue
potion went in the bag.</p>
<p>“Well, today is usually delivery day for me. You see, I run a small
business in crafting potions and elixirs and the like for customers.
Now, normally I would dump this all on you, but given your current...
situation, that won’t work.” A red and orange flask then got placed in
the bag.</p>
<p>“And why is that, exactly?” An opaque green bottle went in next.</p>
<p>Eda tied the bag up and slung it over her shoulder before turning
around and looking Luz in the eye.</p>
<p>“Because anyone who sees you will either run away, soil their pants,
or try to kill you. That would lose me a lot of precious customers.”</p>
<p>“Point taken. So what can I do instead?”</p>
<p>Eda simply shrugged.</p>
<p>“Well, while I’m out on delivery, you could read that book I found.
See if that’ll help you out.”</p>
<p>“I think I can do that. Shouldn’t be too challenging.” Luz said
hopefully.</p>
<p>“Good, good. Oh, and also be sure to watch over King while I'm gone.
I don’t want him getting into my apple blood. Okay, byeeee.” With that,
Eda stepped outside and slammed the door shut. Luz was pretty sure she
heard a tiny “ouch” from Hooty.</p>
<p>Turning her attention back to the kitchen, Luz saw that King had
finished his breakfast(?).</p>
<p>“So... Do you want to do anything, King?” Luz asked while slithering
into the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Can I try some apple blood?”</p>
<p>“What? Eda just said no.”</p>
<p>“Then no.”</p>
<p>Looking around for inspiration, Luz’s eyes fell upon the large pile
of plushies in the corner of the living room.</p>
<p>“Hey King.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“I’ve just gotten word that Francois is plotting a rebellion in the
Great Plushie Army.”</p>
<p>“What!? That’s preposterous! This mutiny must be squashed!”</p>
<p>“Well then, go defend your throne, King!”</p>
<p>At that, King grabbed a butter knife and charged into (the imaginary)
battle.</p>
<p>“That should keep him occupied for a while.” Luz said, finally
getting a chance to read the book Eda had left out.</p>
<p>After situating herself back on the couch, Luz got her first real
look at what she was about to read.</p>
<p>Luz knew that it was cliché to judge a book by its cover, but this
book didn’t appear that interesting based off first glance. The front
cover simply read “Mythical Beasts: From Anati to Zebronkeys” in a old
timey font, with the author being one “M. C. Leech”. The back cover was
completely blank, so that told Luz absolutely nothing about what she was
getting into.</p>
<p>Turning the cover page revealed some publication information about
the book. This was the first edition of the book, and it was published
in 12 CE by KASU Printing House.</p>
<p>"Hey King, how many years ago was 12 CE?"</p>
<p>The diminutive demon took a few seconds to pause his imaginary battle
before responding with, "Uhh... 38."</p>
<p>"Cool, thanks." After that sufficient response, King went back to
protecting the Kingdom of Plushieland from the invading
Francois-ites.</p>
<p>If Luz did her math right (and her assumption that Earth years and
Boiling Isles years were roughly the same length was correct), then the
current year was 50 CE, which meant that the Boiling Isles calendar
started around 1971 in Earth time, and that this book was essentially
published in 1983.</p>
<p>Hopefully the information was still accurate. If Luz had to read a
textbook from 1983 back in school, she would have probably questioned
the education she was receiving.</p>
<p>Flipping to the table of contents, Luz noticed that the entries in
the table of contents were all in alphabetical order. That was
convenient. Skimming ahead to the B section, Luz found Basilisks
sandwiched between "Barmanou" and "Batibat", and the dot leaders pointed
towards page 53 as where she wanted to look.</p>
<p>Turning to that page, Luz began reading.</p>
<p>53 | Basilisks</p>
<p>Basilisks (<em>Basiliscus terrentis</em>) are a potentially
extinct<sup>1</sup> species of beast demons known for their abilities to
shapeshift and to drain magic from witches and demons.</p>
<p><em>Potentially extinct? Obviously, they don't know about me.</em>
Luz thought smugly.</p>
<p>Appearance</p>
<p>In their natural form, basilisks are snake-like in appearance, with
their bodies being covered in scales. The upper half that contains the
head and arms is usually held upright, in a similar posture to that of a
witch or a bipedal demon, while the lower half is kept on the ground
most of the time, used mainly for locomotion. Their teeth consist solely
of cuspids on account of their carnivorous diet. (See Diet section for
more details.) Their ears are large and leathery in texture, sometimes
accompanied by small tufts of hair. They have two arms, located about
halfway up their torso, which end in webbed hands with long, thin,
finger-like claws. Basilisks are capable of growing hair, although this
is mainly restricted to the top of the head and down the spine.</p>
<p>Giving herself a quick once over, Luz confirmed that the book was
right about how she looked.</p>
<p>Shapeshifting</p>
<p>All basilisks have the ability to shapeshift, allowing them to change
the appearance of their body to match whatever they wish. The innards of
the body also change to accommodate for the new outward appearance. For
example, a basilisk could gain a third stomach if the creature they are
shapeshifting into has one, or a second pair of eyes, or whatever they
so desire if they are skilled enough. Most young basilisks are only
capable of copying the forms of others that they see, but more
experienced basilisks could create an entirely new form of their
own.</p>
<p>When a basilisk does shapeshift, whether it be from their natural
form to another or vice versa, that process expends magic, though the
exact amount used up varies from basilisk to basilisk. Some basilisks,
known as <em>neertse</em> (or colloquially as "morph dancers"), are
renowned for the grace and finesse in which they shift from form to
form.</p>
<p>Closing her eyes tightly and picturing herself in her human body, Luz
hoped to feel any sort of change that would indicate she was
morphing.</p>
<p>No luck. She was still a glorified slug.</p>
<p>Magic Draining</p>
<p>To power their shapeshifting abilities, basilisks are required to
drain magic from other creatures, as they have no bile sac of their own
to draw from. Basilisks are capable of draining magic from both living
and deceased creatures. Magic can be drained either directly from the
witch or demon, or indirectly via consumption of a spell circle. Magic
that hasn’t been used for transformation by the basilisk is stored in
both of its two stomachs. The upper stomach is used to digest both
non-magic foods and magic, while the lower stomach is used more as a
reserve for the unused magic. The magic that is digested by the upper
stomach is mainly used to keep the basilisk alive and allows for small
shifts in appearance to quickly be made, while the magic held in the
lower stomach is saved for when large-scale changes need to be made. On
that note, some basilisks have shown the ability to passively absorb
"background magic" without draining any creature of its magic, though
whether this is some form of defect is yet to be fully studied.</p>
<p>When a creature is drained of its magic, the afflicted individual is
usually left sluggish and with a skin tone that is paler than normal.
Basilisk's are capable of killing a person by draining them completely
of magic, but this is a very rare occurrence and is usually only seen in
cases of self defense.</p>
<p>While basilisks are naturally aggressive when it comes to magic
draining, some have shown significant restraint. One notable example is
Illim and Aftran Yrk, co-founders of the Basilisk Peace Movement, where
members only siphoned the magic of deceased or near-death creatures.
Unfortunately, the BPM only lasted for approximately 4 years,
unofficially disbanding after Illim and Aftran were killed by rogue
demon hunters.</p>
<p>Luz thought back to the night before. Draining the warden had come so
easy to her, and yet she had never done it before. She wondered if those
other basilisks had found it that easy, or if they had to go through
some kind of magic draining boot camp. That was a funny visual.</p>
<p>Habitats</p>
<p>While they can be found all across the Isles, basilisks tend to
prefer the hotter, wetter climates found in areas such as the Ribs and
the swamps of the Toes due to their cold-blooded nature. Basilisk
settlements could previously be found in places such as the Hips, though
they have since been destroyed. Local records suggest that basilisk
populations for the larger settlements reached as high as approximately
30,000.</p>
<p>Luz had always preferred the summertime over winter, so that seemed
to add up. It was sad that the little basilisk cities had been
destroyed, though. She would have loved to visit one in its heyday.</p>
<p>Diet</p>
<p>Besides consuming magic, basilisks usually eat a carnivorous diet,
consisting mainly of smaller rodents (echo mice, rats, chipmunks, etc.),
fish, and insects. There have been claims of exceptionally hungry
basilisks eating witches, but there is no evidence to support them.</p>
<p>Here, the book was flat out wrong, although some of it was probably
due to Luz being a weird Basilisk-Human hybrid. Sure, she didn't love
eating her vegetables, and fish wasn't her go to entrée of choice, but
she could force them down whenever Mom gave her The Look™.</p>
<p>Courtship</p>
<p>Aside from their shapeshifting and ability to drain magic, basilisks
are also well known for their elaborate courtship rituals. While the
exact processes aren’t well documented, it is known that courtship is
usually made up of numerous “trials”, where one partner has to prove
themselves worthy of being mates with the other. In recent times, these
practices have fallen out of favor.</p>
<p><em>Glad I won't have to do all that. Sounds kinda messed up, not
gonna lie</em>, Luz thought, letting out a mental sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Reproduction</p>
<p>Basilisks are oviparous, meaning that they lay eggs when they intend
to reproduce. Fertilization of the eggs happens inside the mother
basilisk, when the mother and father are engaging in intercourse. Over
the course of the next 7-8 lunar disappearances, the embryo grows inside
the egg, feeding off the nutrients inside the yolk, before eventually
breaking through the shell and entering the outside world. It is
theorized that basilisks are capable of reproducing with witches/demons,
but as of publication there are no known instances of this
happening.</p>
<p>Madre de Dios<em>, that doesn't sound fun.</em></p>
<p>Known Subspecies of Basilisks</p>
<p><em>Ooh, this looks interesting. I wonder what type I am.</em></p>
<p>Common Basilisk (<em>B. t. vulgaris</em>)</p>
<p>The majority of basilisks fall into this category. When a creature is
referred to as simply a “basilisk”, this is the subspecies that is
implied.</p>
<p>Common basilisks account for approximately 85% of the total basilisk
population.</p>
<p>Greater Basilisk (<em>B. t. dominis</em>)</p>
<p>The greater basilisk is similar to the common basilisk in appearance,
except for the fact that a greater basilisk is typically 3-4x larger in
size. This increase in size means that greater basilisk also need to
consume much more magic if they want to transform, and they likewise
consume magic in larger quantities than a common basilisk. It is rumored
that common basilisks are able to sense the presence of a greater
basilisk, but this has yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Greater basilisks account for approximately 10% of the total basilisk
population.</p>
<p>Unless Luz was due for a massive growth spurt soon, she was pretty
sure she wasn't a greater basilisk.</p>
<p>Twin-tailed Basilisk (<em>B. t. scindus</em>)</p>
<p>A two-tailed variety of basilisks is also known to exist, though in
much smaller quantities than common or greater basilisks. The extra
appendage has no known impact on the health or wellbeing of the
basilisk, and the two tails is actually purported to help the basilisk
maintain stability while in a more upright posture when compared to its
single-tailed counterpart.</p>
<p>Twin-tailed basilisks account for approximately 5% of the total
basilisk population.</p>
<p>Looking behind her, Luz all but confirmed that she was a common
basilisk when she only saw one tail swinging back and forth.</p>
<p>Luz then noticed that there was only one more type of basilisk
left.</p>
<p>Roko's Basilisk (<em>B. t. notia</em>)</p>
<p>Only one instance of <em>B. t. notia</em> has ever been confirmed,
when a cave in the Left Foot was being explored by an amateur spelunker,
identified only as “Roko”, who said they were a witch in the Beast
Keeping Coven on a mission to discover new species of demons. They
described the basilisk in the journal entry below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saw an odd-looking basilisk while exploring that new tunnel system
today. Stands about 10 hands tall, with gray scales covering its entire
body. Has no arms to speak of, and it was slithering around a large pile
of bones. It was incredibly thin, and looked like it hadn’t eaten in
weeks. Would have taken a picture, but there wasn’t enough light, and
didn't want to risk scaring it with a flash photograph. The demon seemed
to be feral and/or insane, only muttering to itself about “creation” and
“the singularity”. I’m going to go back tomorrow and offer it some
leftover food. Doesn’t feel right letting anything suffer when I can
help it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is presumed that Roko died after approaching <em>B. t. notia</em>,
as there were no further entries in their journal, and skeletal remains
were found nearby. When other spelunkers explored the same cave system
at a later date, evidence of <em>B. t. notia</em> could be found in a
series of scratches carved into the rocks that would be consistent with
Roko’s observations when considering a basilisk of that size and the
proportionate claw length and width.</p>
<p><em>Okay, I am</em> <strong>definitely</strong> <em>not that,</em>
was the only thing that Luz could glean from that subsection.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Due to their ability to shapeshift and maintain that shifted form
for an indefinite amount of time, it is highly probable that basilisks
are still alive today in disguise as a witch or demon. Therefore, they
are classified as only being potentially extinct, and as such, they will
be referred to in the present tense.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The book did bring up a good point with that footnote. There could
actually be other basilisks out there! It was just a matter of finding
them that would be the hard part.</p>
<h1 id="luz-cries-on-the-living-room-floor">Luz Cries On The Living Room
Floor</h1>
<p><strong>Schlaftag 2, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>With a renewed sense of optimism, Luz tucked the book under her arm
and turned to check on King. The little guy was probably getting lonely
defending his castle all by himself.</p>
<p>Apparently, while Luz was reading, King had gathered himself an
entire army of plushies. Stuffed animals of all shapes and sizes were
lined up in rows, all of them pointing at Francois. The bunny in
question was currently seated on the armrest of the other couch, and he
had a jagged knife taped to his stuffed arm. On the stuffed animal’s
head was a circlet of paper with the word “Crown” written on it in
crayon.</p>
<p>Luz silently chuckled to herself. King was such an adorable little
tyrant, and he looked ready to rip Francois’ head off in the cutest
possible way.</p>
<p>“Hey King, do you need any help with your little battle thing you
have going on?”</p>
<p>“Ahh, basilisk Luz. You’re assistance is direly needed. The Great
Army has fallen to the Francois-ites, and I have lost power. Will you
help me reclaim my throne?”</p>
<p>“Of course, my liege. I shall help you however I can,” Luz said,
playing along and putting on a posh accent. To add to the immersion, she
also bowed deeply to King. (She couldn’t really take a knee to show
respect, so this was the second best option.)</p>
<p>“So, where are my skills most needed? I do fancy myself to be a
formidable opponent on the battlefield,” Luz continued, adding a little
braggadocious flair.</p>
<p>“While I am sure you’re combat skills are excellent, we already have
more than enough soldiers. Would you consider acting as a spy? I believe
you’re basilisk powers would be well-suited for the role.”</p>
<p>“Well, my lord, you have seen my attempts to shapeshift. They have
been less than successful.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. That is correct. How is it that you normally go about trying to
shapeshift?” King inquired, tapping at his jaw.</p>
<p>“I simply picture whomever I wish to morph into.”</p>
<p>“Have you tried other ways?”</p>
<p>“Oh, uh, no I have not, my lord.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps, instead of simply thinking of what you want to become, you
have to think of the changes themselves? Maybe that would help you go
through with the transformation.”</p>
<p>“I can give it a try.”</p>
<p>Closing her eyes, Luz pictured her current form in her mind’s
eye.</p>
<p>Once she had that solidified, she focused on her right hand and
imagined it shifting from the scaly, clawed basilisk version into the
fleshy human version. As she did that, Luz felt her hand begin to
change. Scales melt away, being replaced with smooth skin. Claws rounded
themselves down and became fingernails. Finally, she felt her fingers
shorten themselves from the Marfan syndrome-length they were before to
one more befitting a regular human.</p>
<p>Feeling the changes finish up, Luz opened her eyes to see an
unequivocally human hand at the end of her basilisk arm.</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh, it actually worked! Thank you so much King!” Luz
exclaimed, dropping the accent out of shock that she actually had a
human hand now.</p>
<p>Luz tried to give King a hug, but he held her at bay with his butter
knife.</p>
<p>“Luz, you have to stay in character!” King reminded her.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah. Right, right. Sorry,” she apologized.</p>
<p>Clearing her throat, Luz put the accent back on and continued the
game.</p>
<p>“Well, my lord, you prove your genius once again.”</p>
<p>After a brief pause, Luz added on, “Am I permitted to finish the rest
of my transformation?”</p>
<p>“But of course! What king would I be if I didn’t? A mockery of one,
that’s what.” King responded.</p>
<p>“Thank you, my lord.”</p>
<p>Now with King’s blessing, Luz closed her eyes again and brought up
the mental image from before. Focusing this time on her left hand, she
went through the same process of imagining the appendage shifting from
basilisk to human and felt her real life hand copy the changes.</p>
<p>Opening her eyes again, Luz now had two human hands attached to
basilisk arms.</p>
<p>Repeating the procedure for her arms, Luz didn’t feel much of a
change, mainly just the scales being replaced by skin.</p>
<p>Luz also learned something at this moment: she could morph clothes!
Given, all she had right now was the sleeves of her precious cat hoodie,
but that was better than having to morph in the buff.</p>
<p>Next, Luz morphed her torso. While there weren’t any radical changes
to her outward appearance, she felt her insides get completely changed.
Her two stomachs combined into one, and she felt her small and large
intestines both reappear. She could also sense her heart move from the
dead-center of her chest back to the left side. That was an odd
sensation, feeling her heartbeat move locations.</p>
<p>She then moved on to morphing her legs and feet. The main change that
accompanied this morph was her tail splitting in two (painlessly,
thankfully) and the two ends shriveling up as they formed into her feet.
Luz slipped up, both literally and figuratively, when she tried to stand
while her feet were still morphing. Trying to stand on what are
essentially flippers isn’t exactly the best idea, apparently, Luz learnt
as she flopped to the ground.</p>
<p>Picking herself up off the floor, Luz was now a human with the head
of a basilisk.</p>
<p><em>Only one step left</em>, Luz thought.</p>
<p>For the <em>pièce de résistance</em>, Luz imagined her basilisk
facial features giving way to her human visage. Her teeth filed down,
her nose jutted out, and her pixie cut emerged from the scraggly mess
atop her head. Her ears receded back and shrunk down, no longer the
giant leathery flaps they were before.</p>
<p>Collapsing to the knees and burying her head in he hands, now fully
human, Luz began to cry. But these were not tears of pain or agony, but
of joy.</p>
<p>Luz finally had her body back.</p>
<p>It was at this exact moment that Edalyn Clawthorne kicked open the
door to her house, empty burlap sack in hand.</p>
<p>“What’s good, dip–” Eda paused at the sight of Luz crying on the
floor.</p>
<p>“Uhh, are you okay, kid?” Eda asked, dropping the bag off by the door
and walking over to the downed teen.</p>
<p>Luz stopped crying, sniffled, and simply gave a thumbs up, not even
bothering to sit up and face Eda.</p>
<p>“So I see you got the whole ‘shapeshifting’ thing figured out,
right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Luz responded, muffled by the floor.</p>
<p>“Well then, congrats kid.” Eda offered Luz her hand, to which Luz
accepted and pulled herself to her (now two human!) feet.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Miss Eda.” Luz said, wiping the tears from her eyes.</p>
<p>“So, how did ya figure it out?”</p>
<p>“Well, it was actually King who gave me the idea. He basically said
‘What if you have to imagine yourself turning into something, not just
imagine something,’ and it worked!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s totally what I said! It was all me!” King interjected,
the imaginary war with Francois forgotten by both him and Luz.</p>
<p>“Well, to whoever came up with it, good job,” Eda said.</p>
<p>Luz suddenly wrapped the two in a tight hug, squeezing with all her
might.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Too tight!” King squeaked out.</p>
<p>“What. Is. This?” Eda questioned between gasps.</p>
<p>“Oh. Sorry, sorry,” Luz said, relinquishing the hug.</p>
<p>“Hey kid, do you want a snack?” Eda asked after catching her
breath.</p>
<p>“Sure?” Luz said uncertainly.</p>
<p>“Great, here ya go,” Eda said, reaching into her pocket and tossing
Luz what looked like a squirming tiny squid with giant eyes.</p>
<p>Luz screamed and dropped the miniature calamari.</p>
<p>Before the “snack” could even hit the ground, Hooty caught the
creature in his mouth and promptly swallowed it.</p>
<p>“That was yummy, hoot hoot!”</p>
<p><strong>Monday, May 23, 2021 | Reality Check Summer Camp | Hoboken,
New Jersey</strong></p>
<p>Day two of camp had gone much better for Number Five. She had grown
much more confident in her ability to hold the Luz disguise after
keeping it on for a full day.</p>
<p>Overall, the camp activities for that day had been a mixed bag of
boring, confusing, and interesting, and that was perfectly fine by
Five’s standards.</p>
<p>Day three started at 8:00 AM, when the members of Cabin 7 were awoken
by the weird screaming box on a pole telling them that it was time to,
“Rise and shine.”</p>
<p>The group was then directed to a large building with long wooden
tables and benches. Five made sure to sit with the other members of
Cabin 7. After all the campers were seated, they were each given a cup
of white liquid that looked an awful lot like smilk, a bowl containing
small round balls of grain, and a spoon. Apparently, the food was called
“sear-yul”, and you were supposed to combine the two ingredients into a
weird soup. After Five poured the balls of grain into the not-smilk, she
got weird looks from the rest of Cabin 7, with Jake claiming that she
was, “doing it backwards.” Masha just laughed quietly. Blushing at the
embarrassing faux pas, Five quickly ate the entire bowl of “sear-yul.”
She noted how much more flavorful the grain balls were than the “food”
she had received while imprisoned by the Emperor.</p>
<p>After they had all finished their bowls, the group compared their
schedules for the day. Five’s day started with Math, followed by U.S.
History, Home Economics, Art, and was finished off by Science at 2:00
PM. Each class was 45 minutes long, and there would be a 15 minute break
between classes. Thankfully, there was also lunch from noon until 1:00,
so nobody would starve. Five then noticed that she shared classes with
all of her cabin-mates. She had Math class with Masha, U.S. History with
Jake, and Science with Marco. Sadly, she’d be all by herself with
complete strangers in home economics and art.</p>
<p>The math class hadn’t been that interesting, with the majority of
class time being taken up by the teacher (Ms. Cabrera) introducing
herself to the class and the campers doing icebreakers to get to know
each other. Luckily, the class was allowed to pick their own seating
arrangements, so Five sat next to Masha for the class. The two ended up
chatting throughout the entire class period, with Mr. Tidwell even
calling them out for it when they got a little too loud.</p>
<p>Five understood absolutely nothing about the history class that
followed. Mr. Fitzhenry barely gave any warning before launching into
the lecture. Five would think that she was beginning to understand some
of the concepts, like “the Declaration of Independence” and “the 13
Colonies”, but then the teacher would launch into a whole different
topic and Five would struggle to keep up. The worst part was that Five
didn’t even get to choose where she sat, being forced into a spot in the
middle of the class, while Jake was seated up front and far away, so she
couldn’t even ask him what anything meant. She did see him diligently
taking notes, though, so she resorted to asking him to explain the
lecture after class was over. He gave a pretty quick overview that was
much easier to understand than the incomprehensible mess that was the
lecture. Five thanked him before going onto her next class.</p>
<p>The home economics course (Or, as Mr. Gustafson called it, “FCS”) was
similar to the math class, with the teacher introducing himself, and
then the students would get to know each other through activities. This
class was a nice reprieve from the mess that was History with Mr.
Fitzhenry. Five even talked to a camper who wasn’t from Cabin 7! Their
name was Max, and they were really nice.</p>
<p>Next was lunch, where all the campers returned to the big building
with tables from before. Once again, Five sat with her cabin-mates for
the meal. Instead of “sear-yul”, they were all getting “sand witches”,
which horrified Five. She thought that humans didn’t know about the
Demon Realm. Her fears were quickly alleviated, though, when she
discovered that “sand witches” were not actual witches and were just
slices of bread with thin cuts of meat and cheese placed between.
Alongside the entrée, they also received an apple (Finally, something
Five could recognize!) and another glass of milk, except this one was
supposed to be drunk straight from the cup and not poured over
anything.</p>
<p>Humans were weird, Five decided.</p>
<p>After lunch was art class, which Five actually found to be quite
therapeutic. The entire class period consisted of each camper sketching
out an important memory. Ms. Sunny, as the instructor asked to be
called, simply walked around the art studio, occasionally commenting on
a camper’s work.</p>
<p>For her sketch, Five drew the old abandoned shack she had escaped to
the human world through. She first focused on the outline of the house,
making sure to get every detail exactly right. It was easy enough,
though, as the image of the house was burned into her brain. Next, she
colored in the doorway, filling it entirely with black. She then worked
on the surroundings of the house, drawing the trees and the birds in the
sky and the small stream that trickled by. She gave the trees (odd in
coloration as they were) green leaves and brown trunks. She colored the
grass around the house a putrid shade of yellow that gradually gave way
to a healthier and more vibrant green as it moved further away. Finally,
she colored the sky a pleasing blue. Sure, she still wasn’t used to a
blue sky, but it was infinitely better than the oppressive purple that
she had seen while on the run.</p>
<p>As Five finished up her sketch, Ms. Sunny walked by and took a look
at Five’s work.</p>
<p>“Wow, Luz. This is very impressive! So, what memory is this
associated with?”</p>
<p>“This is the place where I first felt... free. Yeah, that’s the right
word. Free.”</p>
<p>“Well, if your work is consistently this high quality, you won’t
struggle at all in this class. Keep up the good work!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Ms. Sunny.”</p>
<p>“You are most certainly welcome, Luz.”</p>
<p>Five liked the art class. It was nice.</p>
<p>For her last class of the day, Five headed over to Science with Dr.
Brown. As Five looked around the classroom, she saw a series of posters
on the wall depicting the internals of the human body, each focusing on
a different body system. Letting out a long exhale, she noticed the
massive difference between her natural anatomy and that of a human.
Humans had a <em>lot</em> more going on inside them then she
realized.</p>
<p>After taking a seat next to Marco, Five waited for the teacher to
show up.</p>
<p>After waiting for a solid ten minutes, the door to the classroom was
yanked open, and in stepped an elderly man dressed in a dirty lab coat
and slacks. The crazed look in his eyes, and his even crazier hair, did
not give Five a good first impression of the man.</p>
<p>"I am very sorry for being late on your first day, class. Einstein
had a negative reaction to a new blend of dog food I was trying out and
suffered some gastrointestinal issues that had to be dealt with."</p>
<p>Five buried her head in her hands and hoped the doctor never called
on her to answer a question.</p>
<p>This was going to be a long 45 minutes.</p>
<h1 id="luz-makes-a-deal">Luz Makes A Deal</h1>
<p><strong>Gehetag 3, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Luz awoke to King poking her in the shoulder.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Luz grumbled out, still in the process of waking
up.</p>
<p>“You’re human wonder rectangle started buzzing and made a weird noise
when Eda sent Owlbert on a collection run,” King explained.</p>
<p>“You mean my phone? Wait, my phone! Oh schnitzel, I never replied to
Mom’s text! Where’s my phone?”</p>
<p>“On the coffee table.”</p>
<p>Scrambling out of her sleeping bag as fast as she could, Luz yelled a
quick “Thanks, King!” as she ran down the steps and over to the
couch.</p>
<p>Picking up her phone and checking the notifications, Luz scrolled
past all the junk and spam. Then she finally found what she was
dreading: 6 missed messages and 19 unanswered calls, all from her
mom.</p>
<p>Opening her text app first, Luz finally got to read what her mom had
sent her days prior.</p>
<p><strong>Mom:</strong> How was your first day of summer camp,
mija?<br />
<strong>Mom:</strong> Luz, are you there?<br />
<strong>Mom:</strong> Luz?<br />
<strong>Mom:</strong> Please respond.<br />
<strong>Mom:</strong> ???<br />
<strong>Mom:</strong> I'm going to call you. Please pick up.</p>
<p>As Luz fretted over what to send in reply, King scampered down the
stairs and took a seat on the couch next to her. After stressing over
what the correct response would be in this scenario, Luz simply decided
to break the ice and send “hey mom.”</p>
<p>It explained absolutely nothing, but at least it was something.</p>
<p>The message didn’t send.</p>
<p>Peeking at the top of her phone’s screen, Luz saw that she didn’t
have any cell service.</p>
<p><em>There’s the culprit</em>, she thought.</p>
<p>Then, Luz had an idea.</p>
<p>“You said my phone started buzzing and stuff after Eda opened the
portal door, right?” Luz said, turning to King.</p>
<p>“Yeah, why?”</p>
<p>“I think that’s how my phone got a connection, because the signal
made it through the portal. So if we have the door open, then my message
should send, and Mom will have no idea that I'm in a completely
different dimension!” Luz said excitedly, getting a little to loud at
the end.</p>
<p>"Oi, what are you two yelling about? I'm trying to get my daily cat
nap in over here!" Eda said, shuffling down the stairs, adorned in her
bathrobe and bunny slippers.</p>
<p>"We're trying to send a message to my mom, and we need the portal
door to do it."</p>
<p>"Ugh, fine. Just make it quick. I don't want any actual humans
stumbling through the door."</p>
<p>With that, Eda fished the portal key out of her hair and pressed the
eye. As soon as the door had fully opened, Luz tapped the Retry button,
and the text went through.</p>
<p>"Wait, Miss Eda. Can we keep the portal open a bit longer? I want to
see if my mom will respond. She sounds really worried."</p>
<p>Eda let out a long exhale before answering,"Sure, kid. But if
anything weird comes through that portal, it'll be your fault,
<em>capische</em>?"</p>
<p>"Got it." Luz said with a nod.</p>
<p>And so the waiting game began. Luz knew her mom wasn’t constantly
checking her phone, so that meant she probably had a few minutes to come
up with a reasonable excuse as to why she hadn’t responded for over a
day.</p>
<p>She could say that she had lost her phone in the woods or
somewhere.</p>
<p><em>Hmm. That could work, but then Mom would want to know what I was
doing in the woods, and that could lead to a whole web of lies.</em></p>
<p>Putting that idea on the backburner, Luz tried to think of other
scenarios where she would be phone-less.</p>
<p><em>What if... camp took away all our electronics to force everyone
to interact with each other? Wait, no that one is even worse. Mom would
probably want to know who I made friends with, and that’s just asking
for trouble.</em></p>
<p>Before Luz could even think of any other potential excuses, her phone
began ringing.</p>
<p>“Everybody, be quiet. I can’t let Mom know you guys exist.”</p>
<p>Not even bothering to check the caller ID, Luz answered.</p>
<p>“Hey, Mom.”</p>
<p>“<em>Oh Luz. You’re okay! You had me so worried,</em> cariño<em>.
Where have you been?</em>”</p>
<p>“I’ve just been at camp, <em>mamá</em>. I lost my phone during a
nature hike. I found it just this morning. And, before you ask, no, I
wasn’t in any danger or anything. My phone just slipped out of my pocket
and I didn’t notice until after the hike was over.”</p>
<p>“<em>That’s such a relief,</em> mija<em>. I was worried sick when you
didn’t answer your texts. I thought that you had gotten kidnapped or
something horrible like that.</em>”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, <em>mamá</em>. I’m perfectly fine. I just made a stupid
mistake, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“<em>So how has camp been, then?</em>”</p>
<p>“Its been ok. The activities have been really fun, but the classes
have been hit or miss.”</p>
<p>“<em>How have your cabinmates treated you? Are they nice?</em>”</p>
<p>“Yeah, <em>mamá</em>, they’ve been cool. I think I’m gonna like it
here.”</p>
<p>“<em>That’s great to hear,</em> mi Lucecita<em>.</em> <em>Okay, I’ve
got</em> <em>to head off to work</em>. <em>Be sure to take lots of
pictures so I can hang them up.</em>”</p>
<p>“Okay, mom. I’m gonna go get some breakfast. <em>Te quiero</em>.”</p>
<p>“Te quiero mucho, mija.”</p>
<p>Luz ended the call and motioned that it was okay for everyone else to
start talking again.</p>
<p>“So that’s your mom, huh,” Eda said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, she’s the best. You guys would love her. She can just get a
little... overprotective some times.” Luz responded, thinking back to
all the times Mom had threatened someone with <em>La Chancla</em>.</p>
<p>“What was that language you were speaking with her, at the end? That
certainly wasn’t Common,” Eda questioned.</p>
<p>“Oh, that. That was <em>español</em>. Err, Spanish. Sorry. I can
teach you guys some if you want.”</p>
<p>“No, no. That’s fine. Was just curious, that’s all. Say, how about we
celebrate you getting to talk to your mom with a slug run.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Wait, what’s a slug run?”</p>
<p>“Come along and you’ll find out.”</p>
<p>Before Luz laid a giant dead slug. Flies were abundant, flitting back
and forth. The water surrounding the beached demon was tainted green,
and the stench emanating from the rotting carcass was like nothing Luz
had ever smelled. She wasn’t sure the smell would ever completely go
away.</p>
<p>She should have known something was up when Eda said they were all
going on a celebratory “slug run.” Now, for all Luz knew, a slug run
could be an incredibly peaceful and fun event, but she was wary. Too
many insane and dangerous things had already happened while she was on
the Isles, and she wasn’t going to let her guard down so easily.</p>
<p>“So, what exactly am I looking at here, because this is not exactly
what I had in mind.” Luz asked, already regretting the decision to come
along.</p>
<p>“That, dear child, is the glorious trash slug. It’ll consume anything
and everything given the opportunity, and the stuff it can’t digest it
stores away. And that stuff is why we are here.”</p>
<p>To emphasize her point, Eda stuck her hand in the slug’s mouth and
rummaged around before pulling out an old portable TV.</p>
<p>“Now, to you this may look like any old hunk of metal, but to those
schmucks back in town this could be a... black shadow box that tells you
when you’re gonna die, or something like that.”</p>
<p>“This is gross. I don’t think I’m cut out for this.” Luz replied,
slowly backing away.</p>
<p>“Ahh, come on Luz! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. You get
to wade through the remains of a giant living trash can!” King shouted
whilst reclining on his beach towel, flicking his sunglasses up to peer
at the two.</p>
<p>“Yeah, kid. This will be fun!” Eda then grabbed Luz by the hand and
drug her next to a puddle of bile.</p>
<p>Eda forced Luz’s hand under the surface and wiggled it around until
they found something. Eventually, Luz reluctantly closed her hands
around something spherical. Quickly bringing her hand out of the goop,
Luz examined what she’d found.</p>
<p>It was a tiny goop-covered ball.</p>
<p>Hooray.</p>
<p>“See, kid. Wasn’t that fun?”</p>
<p>“Yeah... Totally fun.”</p>
<p>Having no place better to put it, Luz stuffed the ball in her pocket
and looked up at Eda.</p>
<p>“Look, Miss Eda, I’m not feeling the best. I think I’m gonna go on a
walk or something to clear my head.”</p>
<p>“Alright kid, just come back before we head to the market or you
won’t get a cut of the profits. I need your human knowhow to really
sucker people in.”</p>
<p>Luz glared at the goop ball as she walked through the forest.</p>
<p>“Aggh! What am I supposed to do? It’s not like I can just waltz
through the portal door back home. Mom thinks I’m at camp. I guess I’m
just stuck here. For the next three months. Great.”</p>
<p>Pocketing the goop ball, she kept wading her way through the forest.
The fresh air really did make her feel better. She could actually
breathe without inhaling a stray fly.</p>
<p>Stumbling upon a small clearing, Luz heard another voice.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter what grade you get.”</p>
<p>Diving behind a fallen tree, Luz peeked her head over to investigate
the newcomer, who was pacing back and forth, talking to herself. Luz
also saw that the person was apparently the owner of giant cauldron that
was placed on a wagon.</p>
<p>The girl was short and stocky, standing an inch or two shorter than
Luz, with light skin and navy blue hair that hung to her shoulders. She
had olive green eyes and gold-rimmed glasses, and Luz couldn’t help but
notice the girl’s pointed ears, indicating she was a witch.</p>
<p>For clothing, she wore a gray tunic covered by a black cowl, with a
gold pin keeping the hood secured around her neck, and a black belt
wrapped around her waist. The girl also had a pair of matching sleeves
and tights on, both being a pretty orchid color. If Luz didn’t know any
better, she would assume that this was some kind of school uniform. Did
that mean there was some kind of magic school here?</p>
<p>“Even if I fail the assignment, I can still do good on the final. My
GPA isn’t a reflection of me as a witch. And Dad and Pops are right,
this track has the most opportunities after graduation. Now, get to
class!” That confirmed it. There was a magic school here! Luz
<em>had</em> to see it!</p>
<p>Glasses Girl then strutted forward and pointed off into the distance,
like some kind of power pose, only to step on a stray flower sprouting
from the otherwise barren patch of dirt. Once noticing the fallen flora,
she quickly knelt down and began tracing a spell circle. Luz watched on
in wonder as the flower straightened itself and even began to bloom.</p>
<p>“I am so sorry, little buddy. I didn’t mean that, I promise,” the
girl said to the now-healthy plant.</p>
<p>Luz then felt the ground beneath her rumbling. Suddenly, another
wagon wheeled itself into view, and atop the cauldron sat another girl,
reading a book called “Magic 101”.</p>
<p>This new girl looked a heck of a lot like Melissa Chapman, the
cheerleader that rejected Luz’s invitation to prom. They both had the
same facial structure: pointy nose, small mouth, sharp chin, everything.
The only real differences were the hair color and skin tones. Book Girl
had emerald green hair compared to Melissa’s light blonde with a pink
streak, and Book Girl was extremely pale, while Melissa had a tan.</p>
<p>Closing her book and hopping off the wagon, Book Girl approached the
other witch.</p>
<p>Luz then noticed that the two witches uniforms, while nearly
identical, had one key difference. Book Girl’s tunic sported a gold
badge in the shape of a star, while Glasses Girl’s uniform had no badge
to speak of.</p>
<p>“Hey, Willow,” Book Girl said.</p>
<p>“Hi, Amity,” Willow responded.</p>
<p><em>And now we have their names</em>, Luz thought.</p>
<p>“How’s your abomination assignment coming along?” Amity asked.</p>
<p>“Look for yourself.” Willow said, pointing over to her cauldron.</p>
<p>Amity walked over, and just as she was about to remove the lid, the
cauldron rattled and tipped over, spilling a purple goop with eyeballs
rolling around it A mouth formed from the sludge, emitting a loud
groan.</p>
<p>“Yikes. Hermonculus isn’t going to like that. This can probably still
be salvaged though, and you could get a B if everything goes right.”
Amity said, grimacing.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know. I doubt that’ll happen, though.” Willow replied,
dejected.</p>
<p>Off in the distance, a bell tolled three times.</p>
<p>“Whelp, that’s my signal. Bye, Park.” Amity then hopped back on her
wagon and rode off down the trail.</p>
<p>“Bye, Amity,” Willow said quietly.</p>
<p>After righting her cauldron, Willow started scooping up all the
abomination goop she could, though most of it just fell through her
fingers. Switching target to the rogue eyeballs, she tried to pick one
up, only for it to fall to the ground and splat onto the grass.</p>
<p>“Augh!” Willow let out a scream, “I hate making abominations! I hate
getting bad grades! I can’t stand it anymore!” Her eyes flashed green as
giant roots, covered in thorns, burst from the ground and began writhing
around like snakes.</p>
<p>One of the tendrils shot out and wrapped around Luz’s ankle and
tossed her into the air. Screaming, Luz felt herself lose control of her
morph. When Luz finally landed on the ground, she was back in her
basilisk form.</p>
<p><em>Oh no</em>, was Luz’s only thought when she realized she had
scales again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Willow snapped out of her rage trance and quickly dispelled
the roots.</p>
<p>“Oh no, no, no, no, no! I am so sorry,” Willow apologized.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It’s fine. I didn’t even feel it,” Luz replied.</p>
<p>“Ahh! You can talk?! Wait a minute, you’re a basilisk! Don’t hurt me,
please!” Willow cried out, scrambling away from Luz and falling on her
behind.</p>
<p>“No, no, no. I’m not gonna hurt you, I swear,” Luz said, holding her
hands up, trying to placate the witch’s fears.</p>
<p>“You promise?” Willow said, looking up at the basilisk.</p>
<p>“Do you think we would be having this conversation if I
<em>wanted</em> to hurt you?” Luz deadpanned.</p>
<p>“No.” Willow answered, shaking her head.</p>
<p>“There’s your answer. Now come on, up you go.” Luz said, pulling
Willow to her feet.</p>
<p>Another bell tolled, but only twice this time.</p>
<p>“Wait, I thought basilisks went extinct years ago. How are you...
alive?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s because...” Luz paused to let the tension build up for
the big reveal.</p>
<p>It was time for an experiment.</p>
<p>Closing her eyes and picturing her basilisk body, Luz imagined her
entire body all morphing into her human form.</p>
<p>Scales melted away, forming into the spotted skin Luz knew so well.
Her tail split in two, slowly changing into her legs. Her arms shrunk,
and her human hands emerged from what used to be claws. Her internals
went through that weird gymnastics routine-like movement. Her teeth
dulled and her skull restructured itself. Finally, her hair shortened
and changed from a tangled mess into her classic pixie cut.</p>
<p>Willow simply stared at the now human girl, and Luz probably have the
same reaction if she was in the plant witch’s shoes.</p>
<p>“Ta da! I’m also a human,” Luz said, doing jazz hands for emphasis,
“I’ve lived my entire life in the Human Realm. As a human. I wasn’t
aware I was a basilisk until a few days ago. I was like an undercover
agent for the Demon Realm that was so undercover I didn’t even know I
was undercover.”</p>
<p>Willow chuckled at that.</p>
<p>“Heh, that’s weird. So, besides human and basilisk, can you turn into
anything else?” She asked.</p>
<p>“I mean, theoretically yeah, but right now I’ve just got human mode
and slug mode. Haven’t tried anything else, really.” Luz answered,
shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<p>A clump of abomination goop slid by, letting out another groan.</p>
<p>“Say, do you want some help on your little abomination project?”</p>
<p>“I guess so. I mean, I suck at abominations, but maybe if I get a
good enough grade, then people will stop calling me ‘Half-a-Witch’.”</p>
<p>For the second time that day, Luz had a wonderful idea that was
completely foolproof and was impossible for it to go wrong.</p>
<p>“Then have me morph into your abomination!”</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>“I mean, that thing is just a pile of goop that moans and groans, and
I can morph into said pile of goop and then moan and groan when you’re
presenting. Plus, that means I’ll get to be in a real life magic
school.” Luz couldn’t help but squeal in excitement at the prospect.</p>
<p>“That is true,” Willow said, chuckling.</p>
<p>The two shook hands.</p>
<p>“It’s a deal.”</p>
<h1 id="luz-impersonates-a-homework-assignment">Luz Impersonates A
Homework Assignment</h1>
<p><strong>Gehetag 3, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Hexside School
of Magic and Demonics</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that having a body made entirely of a viscous fluid was
weird, Luz quickly learned. Her movements were slow and sluggish. On the
bright side, though, she could act like a liquid and conform to her
surroundings. In this instance, her “surroundings” were contained to the
inside of Willow’s cauldron.</p>
<p>Poking her head out, Luz saw the main entrance to Hexside School of
Magic and Demonics. She could barely contain her enthusiasm at the
thought of being in a real life magic school.</p>
<p>“Remember the plan, okay? No acting like a human if a teacher is
around.”</p>
<p>Luz slowly nodded and made a grunt, not really being able to talk
without vocal cords.</p>
<p>“Good,” Willow said, replacing the cauldron’s lid. Luz took that as
her cue, and she sunk down to become one with the goo yet again.</p>
<p>Being in the cauldron was odd, to say the least. Luz couldn’t see,
taste, or smell anything, but she could feel the vibrations as the
cauldron moved from place to place, and she could also hear the student
body as she passed by. The voices ranged from what sounded like children
all the way up to teenagers her age and older, as well as the occasional
teacher.</p>
<p>Feeling the cauldron come to a stop, Luz readied herself, gathering
the surrounding abomination goop into a body.</p>
<p>“Willow, you won’t believe the things humans do,” a new voice said.
Luz guessed the speaker to be about 11 or 12 based on the pitch.</p>
<p>“Really? What is it?” Willow replied.</p>
<p>“Did you know that humans intentionally inject themselves with
diseases? But why would they do that? Maybe it’s for biological
warfare.”</p>
<p>Peeking ever so slightly out the cauldron, Luz did a quick 360 check
to make sure no teachers were nearby. Satisfied that there were none in
the area, she ducked back down.</p>
<p>“Okay Augustus, I’m going to show you something, but you have to be
calm.” Willow said, her voice muffled by the thick walls of the
cauldron.</p>
<p>“I can be balm. I mean, calm.” Augustus said, his voice also
dampened.</p>
<p>“Alright. Abomination, rise.”</p>
<p>That was Luz’s cue.</p>
<p>Rising from the pot, Luz let out a loud groan and waved her arms
about.</p>
<p>Finally getting a good look at Augustus, she saw that he was wearing
a similar uniform to Willow’s except his sleeves and leggings were a
light blue color instead of orchid. Physically, the boy was
significantly shorter than her and had a darker complexion. His hair was
cut in a stylish fade, and his dark blue eyes were wide with a youthful
wonder about them.</p>
<p>“Woah. Great job, Willow. That’s a really good abomination!”</p>
<p>“But that’s not all I have to show you, Augustus. Go ahead, Luz. The
coast is clear.”</p>
<p>Nodding, Luz morphed human, even though she ended up still covered
head to toe in abomination goop.</p>
<p>“Luz Noceda, at your service,” she said, standing up and bowing
deeply.</p>
<p>“Luz, abominations don’t act like that,” Willow scolded.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah. I know. Just hamming it up for the reveal.”</p>
<p>“Impossible. There’s no way,” Augustus said, rubbing at his ears.</p>
<p>“Augustus here is the president of the Human Appreciation Society.
Most witches couldn’t identify a human right away, but he’s an expert,”
Willow explained.</p>
<p>“Where are your fins?”</p>
<p>“Humans, uh, don’t have fins. And also, those injections you were
talking about are for creating an immunity to the disease being
injected, not for warfare. No need to be worried, Gus,” Luz replied to
the misinformed witch.</p>
<p>“Gus?” The newly dubbed witch questioned.</p>
<p>“You know, Augustus, Gus. It’s a pretty common nickname where I’m
from.”</p>
<p>“Wait, you mean I just got a nickname? From a human? Wow. Gus. This
is the best day ever,” Gus said.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a loud scream echoed through the halls. Luz frantically
looked around, searching for the source.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to get to spelling class. See you at lunch, guys,” Gus
said, grabbing a wand and a textbook from his locker before heading
off.</p>
<p>Willow waved goodbye before turning to Luz. “Alright, back into the
pit of despair you go.”</p>
<p>Luz simply hissed as she morphed back into an abomination and sunk
into the cauldron.</p>
<p>Feeling the cart come to a stop, Luz presumed that she and Willow had
reached their destination: Abominations 101, taught by Professor
Hermonculus.</p>
<p>Based off the chatter that Luz could hear, the students in this class
were a mixed bag on how they felt about the assignment.</p>
<p>Suddenly, all the talking died down. Luz guessed that that meant the
professor had just shown up.</p>
<p>“Alright class, today we will be beginning your abomination
presentations. I will pick the order in which you will be presenting.
During your presentation, you will first order your abomination to rise
from its cauldron before giving it two commands of your choosing. If
your abomination incorrectly performs a command or is significantly
deformed in appearance, your presentation will be cut short and you will
fail the assignment. Is this understood?”</p>
<p>A chorus of “Yes, sir!” rung out from the class.</p>
<p>“Good. Up first will be Jerbo.”</p>
<p>“Ugh. Too many eyeballs. How do you mess up this egregiously?
Fail.”</p>
<p>The student slowly wheeled their cauldron away.</p>
<p>That was the fourth student who barely even get a chance to present.
Luz felt bad for them.</p>
<p>“These presentations have been pathetic. If the next one is a
failure, then you’ll all receive extra homework for the rest of the
semester.”</p>
<p>A collection of groans and shouts of protests followed the teacher’s
proclamation.</p>
<p>After waiting for the cacophony to die down, the professor continued.
“The next to present will be–”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, sir, but I’m ready to present my abomination,” Amity
interrupted.</p>
<p>Hermonculus chuckled before continuing, “I know your abomination will
be stellar, Miss Blight, but we have to save the best for last. How
about... Willow.”</p>
<p>Luz heard another round of groans, this time intermixed with students
complaining about “Half-a-Witch” dooming them to extra homework.</p>
<p>Then, Luz felt the cauldron start to move, so she started to collect
the goop up into what would be her body.</p>
<p>“Abomination, rise.” Willow commanded after letting the goop come to
a rest.</p>
<p>Slowly emerging from the cauldron, Luz let out a long moan. It was
time for her to act like a mindless blob of goop.</p>
<p>“Abomination, bow.”</p>
<p>Bending at the waist, Luz did as she was told, being sure to keep her
arms and back straight.</p>
<p>“Abomination, draw.”</p>
<p>Clambering out of the pot and slowly walking over to the blackboard,
Luz picked up a piece of chalk and drew a stereotypical quaint little
house with a chimney. After finishing her masterpiece, Luz awaited
further instructions.</p>
<p>“This is a very impressive abomination, Miss Park. But does it
speak?” The professor asked, marking something down on a piece of
paper.</p>
<p>“No, sir, it does not. I couldn’t get the vocal cords to properly
develop.” Willow answered. The professor then wrote something else down
on the slip of paper.</p>
<p>“Hmm. In that case, you get an A minus. Please return to your seat,
Miss Park.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir. Abomination, back in the cauldron.”</p>
<p>Luz took that as her sign, climbing back into the pot and melting
down to become one with the goo yet again.</p>
<p>Willow then placed the lid back on the cauldron and wheeled it over
to her desk before sitting back down.</p>
<p>Luz heard the bell scream and all the students quickly started
packing up. Then, the professor’s voice broke through the noise.</p>
<p>“Alright students. We will continue your presentations tomorrow, and
Miss Blight, you will be going first. Miss Park, I would like to talk
with you after the room clears.”</p>
<p>Luz was pretty sure she could hear Willow gulp.</p>
<p>Gradually, the students filtered out of the room until it was just
Willow, Luz, and Hermonculus.</p>
<p>“You wanted to talk with me, sir,” Willow said, walking to the front
of the room.</p>
<p>“Yes, I do. Your presentation today was very good. I’ve rarely seen a
student make such strides in such a short amount of time. Tell me, if
you please, what led to this sudden improvement in your abomination
skills?”</p>
<p>“Well, sir, would you believe me if I said that Amity was offering
private tutoring sessions?” Willow said, lying through her teeth.</p>
<p>“Ahh, the young Blight, always striving for extra credit. I’ll have
to ask her about that. Thank you, that’s all I needed. Head off to your
next class, Miss Park.”</p>
<p>“Have a good day, sir,” Willow said, before retrieving her cauldron
and wheeling it to the next class.</p>
<p>Willow’s next class was some kind of math or history course or
something. Luz wasn’t exactly sure. The teacher, a salamander-like
fellow, gave a very enthusiastic lecture about the “heximal system.” Luz
didn’t have any idea what that was, and she could only understand about
half of what the instructor was saying, but she listened nonetheless. A
funny thing happened about halfway through the lecture, though. Luz was
pretty sure she heard someone outside yell “NOOO! SCHOOL!” in a very
dramatic fashion. She couldn’t tell who it was, sadly.</p>
<p>After that class was lunch, and Luz was glad to finally get some food
in her stomach. After making sure the room was free of faculty members,
Luz cautiously morphed human and struck up a conversation with Willow
and Gus. She remained in the cauldron, though. She didn’t want to risk
being an rogue abomination on the loose.</p>
<p>“I am famished. Can I have some of your food? I haven’t eaten all
day.” Luz asked the two, leaning over the edge of the pot.</p>
<p>“Sure. Do you want some of my PB and J?” Gus offered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ll take– Wait,” Luz cut herself off. “What does PB and J
stand for?”</p>
<p>“Pain butter and jalapeño,” the boy answered.</p>
<p>“Never mind, then.”</p>
<p>“You can take half of my salad. Dad always packs way too much,”
Willow said, holding out a partially eaten bowl.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you so much,” Luz said, taking the bowl with her and
retreating into the cauldron. Eating a few bites, she noticed the greens
had an odd dressing on them that she couldn’t quite place.</p>
<p>“Let’s just hope nobody saw that,” Willow said.</p>
<p>“Why is that?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Because abominations don’t need to eat.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Interesting.”</p>
<p>Willow then looked around and saw that Amity Blight was approaching
their table. Oh no, had she discovered that Willow was cheating?</p>
<p>“Amity is coming over, quick, turn into an abomination,” Willow
yell-whispered to Luz, who was still hiding in the pot.</p>
<p>Letting out a tiny “Eep!” and stuffing the salad bowl into the goop,
Luz quickly morphed, finishing just as Amity showed up.</p>
<p>“Hey Willow, Augustus. Just wanted to come over and congratulate you,
Willow. You did really good on your presentation. I told you it could be
salvaged. Heck, you did even better than I thought.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Amity,” Willow responded.</p>
<p>Willow’s abomination was odd, Amity concluded. When she had finished
her lunch, she had gone over to congratulate Park on her presentation,
only to see the witch in question dropping a salad bowl into her
cauldron. That was weird, mainly on account of abomination’s not needing
to eat. Maybe Willow was rewarding it, or something along those lines?
Though a salad was an odd choice of reward. Plus, Amity was pretty sure
that she had seen something that was distinctly not an abomination in
Willow’s cauldron before during the same lunch period. It looked to be a
witch about her age. But Amity was probably just seeing things, though.
She had stayed up all night perfecting her abomination, after all, so
hallucinations weren’t exactly out of the question.</p>
<p>After the brief scare that was lunch, Luz continued accompanying
Willow to her next class: spelling. While Luz had initially thought this
was going to be some kind of class teaching the students how to properly
spell words, she quickly realized that the course was actually about the
science of casting magical spells, which was objectively way more cool.
The lesson had been really interesting, as well. Apparently, witches all
had this thing called a “bile sac” that grew out of their heart that
allowed them to do magic, and the sac would naturally get replenished by
the magic emanating from the decomposing body of the Titan. That was
metal as heck.</p>
<p>After the class had finished up, it was just Willow, Gus, and Luz all
alone in the room. Sensing the opportunity to stretch her legs, Luz
morphed human and crawled out of the cauldron.</p>
<p>“Wow. Who knew being stuck in a pot all do could work up such a
sweat? Thankfully, there’s only one more class. High five!”</p>
<p>The two witches stared at her, blank expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>“Slap my hand with yours. It’s a thing human friends do,” Luz
explained.</p>
<p>Gus hesitantly placed his palm against Luz’s. After realizing that it
didn’t hurt, he pulled his hand back and high fived her again, although
with much more vigor this time.</p>
<p>“Humans do this all the time? How did I never know?” Gus said, amazed
at the euphoric rush of the high five.</p>
<p>He then slapped palms with Luz three more times, only for Luz to
catch his wrist on the next attempt.</p>
<p>“When people high five, its usually only once or twice.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Darn,” Gus said sadly.</p>
<p>A scream echoed through the halls, indicating the last class period
was about to begin.</p>
<p>“Alright, off we go,” Luz said, reentering the pot and morphing back
into an abomination.</p>
<p>Amity now knew that something was up. That witch she had seen during
lunch had just climbed into Willow’s cauldron and then turned into an
abomination! While there wasn’t anything in the school rulebook that
explicitly stated that students weren’t allowed to turn into
abominations, this had to be a violation of some kind. As Top Student of
the Abomination Track, Amity had a reputation to uphold, and that came
with certain responsibilities. Those responsibilities included reporting
potential academic dishonesty. Shaking her head, Amity quickly walked
over to Principal Bump’s office. “Oh Willow, what have you gotten
yourself into.”</p>
<p>The final class of the day also turned out to be interesting, but for
a very different reason.</p>
<p>Halfway through the class period, the PA system screeched to
life.</p>
<p>“<em>Willow Park, please report to Principal Bump’s office, and bring
your school-issued cauldron and abomination fluid.</em>”</p>
<p>The entire class turned to stare at the girl as she slowly made her
way out of the room, cauldron in tow.</p>
<p>Once they were out of sight of everyone, Luz morphed human and stuck
her head out of the pot.</p>
<p>“Who knows why you’re being sent to the principal’s office? Maybe he
was really impressed by your magical prowess and wanted to see it for
himself,” Luz joked, trying to break the tension.</p>
<p>“Yeah. That’s definitely why. Definitely,” Willow said. She didn’t
even believe herself.</p>
<p>“Hey, if everything goes south, don’t worry, because I’ve got a
plan.”</p>
<p>“And what plan is that?”</p>
<p>Not saying anything, Luz simply morphed back into an abomination.</p>
<p>Slowly nudging the door to Bump’s office open, Willow saw that it
wasn’t just the principal who was there. Amity was present, too.</p>
<p>“Hello, Miss Park.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Principal Bump. Hi, Amity,” Willow said meekly.</p>
<p>“Principal Bump, can I say something before we begin?” Amity quickly
said.</p>
<p>“Yes, you may.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Look, Willow, whatever happens here, don’t think of it as
a personal attack on you, or anything. I take my role as Top Student
very seriously, and I would have done this if I saw anyone else I
thought was cheating, not just you. Sorry, for all its worth,” Amity
said, before backing away into the corner of the room.</p>
<p>“Miss Blight there told me that she believed you to be cheating in
regard to your project for Abominations 101. While she wasn’t specific,
she mentioned that she reportedly saw you placing ‘foreign materials’ in
your abomination cauldron. Do you have anything you would like to say
against these accusations?”</p>
<p>“No, sir, I do not.”</p>
<p>“Then I suppose you wouldn’t mind me performing an analysis of your
abomination, would you?”</p>
<p>“Well, sir, I have the list of ingredients I used right here,” Willow
said, reaching into her pocket and pulling out a small slip of
paper.</p>
<p>“The ingredients you used are why you are here, Miss Park. Now, will
you allow me to perform an analysis of your abomination?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” Willow replied quietly.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Abomination, rise,” Bump said.</p>
<p>Luz did exactly that, rising from the cauldron and remaining
perfectly still afterwards.</p>
<p>“Abomination, lie,” Bump commanded, pointing towards his desk.</p>
<p>Slowly clambering over, Luz crawled atop the principal’s desk.</p>
<p>“Hmm. This is a near perfect abomination, Miss Park. Normally, this
would be cause for celebration, but given the circumstance’s, we’ll have
to wait and see,” Bump noted, lifting and dropping Luz’s arm, inspecting
it closely.</p>
<p>“Miss Park, I think I’m going to need a closer look at your
abomination,” the principal continued.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that, sir?” Willow asked.</p>
<p>“Vivisection, Miss Park,” Bump replied, walking to the other side of
the desk and pulling out an incredibly sharp-looking dagger.</p>
<p>“Given that this is your project, I’ll allow you the first incision,”
he then said, handing the blade over to Willow.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Luz snapped upright and turned to face Bump. Before anyone
could react, she opened her mouth and began to drain the principal. Once
the witch was weakened enough to not be an immediate threat, Luz quickly
morphed human.</p>
<p>Scrambling off the table and grabbing Willow by the arm, the two
ran.</p>
<h1 id="luz-tries-to-eat-a-schools-defense-system">Luz Tries To Eat A
School’s Defense System</h1>
<p><strong>Gehetag 3, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Hexside School
of Magic and Demonics</strong></p>
<p>Hieronmyous Bump had encountered many a creature during his tenure at
Hexside. That came with the territory of being principal for nearly 40
years. Though, Hieronmyous had never met a live basilisk before. In
fact, he’d thought them to be extinct for the majority of his life.
Howver, because he’d just had (what he thought to be) an abomination
partially drain him of his magic and then subsequently shapeshift into a
witch, he’d have to question whether or not they had been truly hunted
out of existence.</p>
<p>If he was in any other situation than right now, Hieronmyous would
probably have been questioning how Miss Park came in contact with the
basilisk. The stories of old had painted basilisks as creatures of pure
aggression, siphoning the magic of any creature that came close to them.
Though, based off what he had just seen, maybe the stories weren’t
completely accurate. Somehow, by the grace of the Titan, Miss Park had
convinced a basilisk to act as her abomination for a measly homework
assignment.</p>
<p>But now was not the time for questions, now was the time for
action.</p>
<p>He needed to protect his students.</p>
<p>“Miss Blight, could you please help me over to the wall by the door?”
He asked.</p>
<p>The young Blight stood frozen temporarily before responding, “Of
course, Principal Bump.” She then quickly walked over to the weakened
principal and positioned the man to the side of the door.</p>
<p>Hoping he had enough magic left in him to activate the school’s
lockdown defense system, Bump slammed his palms against the wall and
said a silent prayer that the Titan would keep everyone safe, especially
Willow.</p>
<p>When he saw the telltale red pattern start spreading on the wall,
Bump collapsed to his knees in exhaustion.</p>
<p>“Miss Blight, go get Miss Park and get her away from that creature.
Forcefully, if you have to,” he said through labored breathing.</p>
<p>“Of course I will, sir.”</p>
<p>Luz ran, dragging Willow behind her. Rounding a corner, the two
slowed down, catching their breath.</p>
<p>“Luz, why did you just drain our principal?” Willow asked, slumping
against a column and taking a seat on the floor.</p>
<p>“It was a reflex, okay. I was in danger and I couldn’t think of
anything better to do. What was I supposed to do, let you cut me open?”
Luz retorted, pacing nervously.</p>
<p>“Yes! Abomination’s can’t feel pain and are essentially immortal!”
Willow said.</p>
<p>“Oh.” That stopped Luz dead in her tracks.</p>
<p>“Ugh, come on. Let’s get out of here.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a red shield-like apparition encased the archway.</p>
<p>“And Bump just activated the defense system. Rats,” Willow said,
slowly climbing to her feet.</p>
<p>“I’m guessing we’re stuck here, then.”</p>
<p>Willow paused, and thought for a second. If she remembered correctly,
then the defense system should only work against intruders, and not
against students.</p>
<p>“Wait, let me try something.” Willow then proceeded to walk through
the shield as if it wasn’t there.</p>
<p>“Yes, it worked! Now you try, Luz,” Willow continued, motioning Luz
to follow her through the archway.</p>
<p>Luz tried to walk through the red apparition, only for it to push her
back.</p>
<p>“Of course. You’ve got to be kidding me,” Luz complained.</p>
<p>Luz then tried to drain the blockade of its magic. Maybe that would
work.</p>
<p>Opening her mouth, Luz did her best to siphon the magic precluding
her from being with her newfound friend, only for nothing to happen. Luz
could feel her stomach filling up, but the shield remain unaffected.</p>
<p>“Willow! Willow, where are you?” Luz recognized that voice as
belonging to Amity.</p>
<p>“Willow, stay away from that thing!” Amity ran and tackled Willow,
the two sliding along the floor. Amity then scrambled back to her feet
and turned to face Luz.</p>
<p>“You aren’t hurting anyone else, you monster,” Amity said, making
sure to not cross the boundary and risk getting her magic drained.</p>
<p>Luz slowly backed away from the angry witch, eventually finding
herself pressing up against another one of the blockades.</p>
<p>“I was scared, okay! I thought I was going to get dissected, and my
survival instincts took over,” Luz said quietly.</p>
<p>“What did you just say?” Amity asked.</p>
<p>“I panicked. I didn’t want to hurt your principal, I swear. It
just... happened. I had no control over it,” Luz said, louder this
time.</p>
<p>“She’s telling the truth,” Willow said, standing back up, “In the few
hours that I’ve known her, Luz has been nothing but a wonderful person,
and I never felt threatened by her in the slightest.” To emphasize her
point, Willow then crossed the boundary separating her and Luz and slung
her arm across the basilisk’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“See?” Willow continued, “I’m not getting my magic drained. I’m fine,
Amity.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m not a danger to anyone. Except Warden Wrath. He acts like
a creep whenever he sees Miss Eda,” Luz said defensively.</p>
<p>Amity paused at the name. “You don’t mean ‘Miss Eda’ as in ‘Eda the
Owl Lady’, do you?”</p>
<p>“The one and only!” Luz said with a chipper smile.</p>
<p>Amity facepalmed. “Of course the Owl Lady would be harboring a
basilisk, because why wouldn’t she be.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Eda’s the best.”</p>
<p>Amity let out a long exhale. “Look, if I cross this barrier, do you
promise not to drain me of my magic and leave me for dead?”</p>
<p>“I promise. Scout’s honor,” Luz said, holding up her right hand and
touching her pinky and thumb, palm facing outward.</p>
<p>“You’re a member of the Emperor’s Coven?!” Amity said, shocked at the
apparent revelation.</p>
<p>“What’s the Emperor’s Coven?” Luz asked, a puzzled look on her
face.</p>
<p>“Nevermind then,” Amity said, “Okay, I’m coming over, but if you so
much as make one false move, I’m going back to the other side.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry,” Luz reassured her, “There won’t be any
funny business.”</p>
<p>“Good.” With that, Amity cautiosly stepped through the barrier and
approached Luz.</p>
<p>“Hold on!” Willow said, jumping between the two, “How about you two
formally introduce yourselves. To prove you aren’t a threat to each
other and all that, ya know?”</p>
<p>“I think that is reasonable enough. Hello. I’m Amity Blight, Top
Student of the Abominations track and heir apparent of Blight
Industries,” Amity said, sticking out her hand.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, Amity Blight. My name is Luz Noceda, and I’m a
human-basilisk hybrid from the Human Realm,” Luz responded, grabbing
Amity’s hand and gave it a firm shake.</p>
<p>“I thought basilisks were extinct.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ve been getting that a lot recently. Though, I kinda know
next to nothing about my more slithery side. Like, Miss Eda has a book
that had some information on basilisks, but none of the stuff in it was
really that useful to me.”</p>
<p>“Well, I work at the local public library, so maybe I could help you
find a more advanced book on the subject.”</p>
<p>“Really? That would be super helpful.”</p>
<p>“Given how large the records are, we’d undoubtedly find something
that’s useful. Just so you know, I’ll be working at the GPL over the
weekend, so would either of those days work for you?”</p>
<p>“Probably? Unless Miss Eda ropes me into one of her schemes, of
course.”</p>
<p>“Alright then, it’s a date. Just stop by anytime from 10 to 2 and
I’ll be there. Also, you should probably come disguised as witch or
demon. Human’s tend to stick out around Bonesborough. Look, I’ve really
got to go. Mom is probably waiting by the door so she can lecture me
about being late.”</p>
<p>“Okay, see you at the library!” Luz said, before adding on, “Wait,
can you go get Bump to drop the shield thingies? Miss Eda’s probably
getting worried.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can go explain what all just happened to him. I’m already
late, so what’s five more miutes? Let’s just hope Bump’s in a forgiving
mood.” Amity then jogged off in the direction of Bump’s office.</p>
<p>“Thank you!” Luz yelled to the departing witch.</p>
<p>Luz then walked over to a flat section of the wall and slid down to
the floor, with Willow joining her soon after.</p>
<p>“So, how do you like Hexside?” Willow asked.</p>
<p>“I really liked it, to be honest. All the classes were really fun and
they were all <em>way</em> better than the stuff that’s taught at human
schools. I’d take spelling class over physics any day of the week. It
did get a little boring staying in the cauldron most of the day, though,
but I couldn’t blow my cover and all that.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I enjoy being at Hexside, too. I just wish I didn’t have to be
on the Abominations track.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever considered switching tracks? I think you’d do great in
the Plant track.”</p>
<p>“That’s the problem: nobody has ever switched tracks. There’s this
precedent where once you pick a track, that’s your track for your entire
school career, and I doubt Bump will just let me swap tracks at a
moments notice.”</p>
<p>“Well maybe you just have to prove to him that you’ll do better on
the Plant track. Something that will make him go, ‘Wow, I completely
misjudged you Willow. Here, you’re on the plant track now.’”</p>
<p>“Do you really think that would work?”</p>
<p>“I mean, it wouldn’t hurt to try, would it?”</p>
<p>“I suppose not.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the red barricades surrounding the two disappeared with an
audible <em>WOOSH</em>.</p>
<p>Luz rose to her feet and looked around the corner to see Principal
Bump slowly approaching, with no Amity to be seen. Luz noticed that the
elderly witch was using a staff as a walking stick, though it looked as
though the staff was missing some kind of topper.</p>
<p>Luz stood as still as possible, staring down at her shoes.</p>
<p>“So, you’re the basilisk that posed as Miss Park’s abomination. Luz
Noceda, was it?” Bump asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, I am, and I am very sorry about–” Luz said quietly, before
being cut off.</p>
<p>“No need for apologies, Miss Noceda. You were afraid and acted
accordingly, and it just so happens that your response to fear happens
to be...”</p>
<p>“To nearly kill you?”</p>
<p>“I was going to say using your Titan-given abilities, but that works
to, I suppose,” Bump paused for a bit before continuing, “Look, Miss
Noceda. I’ve learned in my years here at Hexside that holding grudges
only leads to a bottomless pit of despair, and I don’t want that for
either of us.”</p>
<p>“So, then what are we going to do?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“I take it that you enjoyed your day here, correct?” Bump asked in
response after thinking for a few seconds.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was awesome,” Luz said quickly.</p>
<p>“And are you currently receiving any form of education?”</p>
<p>“Not really, no.”</p>
<p>“Then I have a solution where we both benefit: you become a student
here at Hexside. Think about it. You could come here as a sort of
exchange student, offering new perspectives for all your classes and
getting a proper education, and the student body at large would benefit
from you attending as well.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do it on one condition.”</p>
<p>“And what is that?”</p>
<p>“Let Willow switch to the Plant Magic track.”</p>
<p>“Miss Noceda, that would be breaking decades worth of precedent, so
unless you have indipsutable proof that Willow is better suited in the
Plant track, then I will have to deny your request. I can’t have
students switching tracks whenever they fancy.”</p>
<p>“Well then, we’ll just have to show you. Hey Willow! Get over here
and show Bump how awesome of a plant witch you are!”</p>
<p>“While I would love to do that, plant magic sorta requires, ya know,
plants, of which there are none nearby,” Willow said, walking over to
join the two.</p>
<p>Reaching into her pocket and scrounging around, Luz eventually pulled
out a handful of coins and that goop-covered ball from the trash
slug.</p>
<p>“Would any of these help?” Luz said hopefully.</p>
<p>“Hmm. The strange looking coins, no, but I could definitely use that
seed.” Willow replied, picking up the seed and examining it.</p>
<p>“That’s a seed?” Luz asked, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Willow simply stared at the basilisk, a dissapointed look on her
face.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Willow spun a spell circle around the seed, and
with a shout of, “GROW!”, gigantic vines, similar to the ones that had
ensnared Luz’s ankle hours prior, sprouted from the seed. The vines
spread all over the place, racing around corners, wrapping around
columns, and a few even broke through some windows and escaped to the
outside world. Small pink flowers even began to bloom from some of the
vines.</p>
<p>“Incredible,” was all Bump could say in response to the sheer display
of power he’d just witnessed. “Willow Park, effective immediately, you
will no longer study on the Abominations track, but will instead be on
the Plant Magic track.” Casting a small spell circle, Willow’s sleeves
and leggings switched from the orchid color of Abominations track to the
green of the Plant track.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Principal Bump,” Willow said.</p>
<p>“Yay, congrats Willow!” Luz said, running and giving the witch a hug,
spinning the two of them around in a circle.</p>
<p>“Now I just have to figure out how to tell my dads,” Willow said,
picking at the newly-green sleeves of her tunic.</p>
<p>Bump then cleared his throat, pausing the celebration.</p>
<p>“Miss Noceda, there is one caveat preventing you from joining Hexisde
right this instant. We have a policy where students who wish to attend
any higher-level courses have to know at least two spells. Do you happen
to know any spells?”</p>
<p>“Does shapeshifting count as a spell?” Luz asked hopefully.</p>
<p>“Does your shapeshifting require the usage of a spell circle?” Bump
inquired.</p>
<p>“Not really, no.”</p>
<p>“Then in the eyes of the school it does not count as a spell.”</p>
<p>“Rats,” Luz said in a dissappointed tone.</p>
<p>“Hmm... Miss Blight told me that you said you were currently living
with Edalyn Clawthorne. Is that right?”</p>
<p>“Yup. I’ve even got my own room and everything,” Luz said
proudly.</p>
<p>“Then ask Edalyn to teach you some spells. While she might have had a
knack for causing a ruckus, she was also an incredible student, and I’m
sure she could pass some of her knowledge on down to you.”</p>
<p>“Well, there’s one problem with that: I don’t exactly have a bile sac
to be able to do magic.”</p>
<p>“That is quite the conundrum. However, I do recall that witches of
old used a different method of casting spells prior to the development
of the bile sac, though the exact details have been muddied by time.
That could be worth researching into.”</p>
<p>“So what you’re saying is that, if I want to attend this school, then
I’ll basically have to completely rediscover a lost method of casting
spells.”</p>
<p>“Essentially, yes. Either that, or you could attempt to shapeshift
yourself a bile sac and pray to the Titan that it doesn’t kill you
outright.”</p>
<p>“Alright, rediscovering lost magic it is. Do you know any, like,
ancient scrolls or tomes I could read from that could tell me more?”</p>
<p>“Based on the subject matter, they would most likely be kept in the
restricted section of the Bonesborough Public Library, so I wish you the
best of luck in finding a way to access them without proper
clearance.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, future-Principal Bump.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. Now please, leave me be, because I have some paperwork
that needs attended to.”</p>
<p>“Is it paperwork for me to officially go here?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s to report all the damage that Miss Park just caused to the
centuries old stained glass windows. Now both of you leave before you
destroy something else.”</p>
<p>Luz didn’t need to be told a third time, so she and Willow both went
outside to the main courtyard of the school, only to find Gus standing
there, all by himself, apparently waiting for them.</p>
<p>Noticing the two, Gus ran up to them.</p>
<p>“I just had the best idea in the history of ideas. What if you could
high five <em>yourself</em>?”</p>
<p>“Gus, that’s called clapping,” Luz deadpanned.</p>
<p>“Oh. Darn.”</p>
<h1 id="luz-applies-her-first-aid-training">Luz Applies Her First Aid
Training</h1>
<p><strong>Kriegstag 3, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>“Hey, King, I need your opinion on something.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“So, for my little library research trip thing with Amity, do you
think I should disguise myself as a scary-looking demon, or should I go
as a cute little innocent-looking demon?”</p>
<p>“You do realize you could just shapeshift yourself witch ears,
right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know I can do that, but I want to try and stretch my
abilities, you know? I wanna see what I’m capable of.”</p>
<p>“Well, in that case, then do the spooky demon disguise. Looking cute
and cuddly is just asking for someone to try and eat you as.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Do you think this is appropriately scary, King?” Luz then
handed the pint-sized creature a sketch she had been working on for a
while.</p>
<p>The creature Luz had drawn, which she called Kraugh, was a bipedal,
two-armed demon. Standing around 7 feet tall, it was covered in dark
green skin that was rough and scaly. The head of the creature, which Luz
had spent more time on than she wanted to admit, was very snakelike,
being flat and triangular, with a sharp beak and beady little eyes. From
each of the major joints, a long curved blade protruded. The feet and
hands of the demon both ended in three short claws that were also
curved, albeit to a lesser extent. Each hand also had an opposable
thumb, though it was sans blade. (Luz added that to the design solely so
she could pick up things without slicing them in half.) The Kraugh also
featured a large tail hanging behind the legs, tipped with even more
blades, that also doubled for stabilizing the tall demon.</p>
<p>Overall, Luz thought the design would fit right in with all the other
nightmare-inducing creatures she had seen during her time on the
Isles.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, this would go great in my army of terrors,” King said,
giving the drawing back to Luz.</p>
<p>“Do you think I should give it a test run? Make sure it looks right
and all that?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Why not?” King responded, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>“I like you’re thinking,” Luz said, giving a smile.</p>
<p>Closing her eyes, Luz first pictured her human form. Then, she
imagined her body turning into Kraugh.</p>
<p>The first change she felt was a tail shooting out from her the bottom
of her spine. Looking behind her, Luz saw a weird fleshy material spread
down the new appendage, completely coating it. After her tail was
covered by the foreign material, a trio of spikes erupted from the
tip.</p>
<p>Before Luz could even get a chance to give the tail a practice
<em>SWISH</em> back and forth, the next stage of changes came. Her
middle and ringer fingers melded together, and she could feel something
similar happening to her toes. Her spine lengthened, rocketing her up to
nearly touching the ceiling with her head. <em>Maybe I can finally be
good at basketball now</em>, Luz joked mentally.</p>
<p>Next, Luz’s face deformed. Her nose withered away, only leaving
behind the nostrils. Her eyes that were normally wide and constantly
examining the strange new world shrunk down to mere dots. Her ears
pinned themselves flat to her head, barely visible to the naked eye. Her
lips eroded into nothing while the rest of her mouth jutted outwards and
hardened, becoming a beak. As a slight reprieve, her tongue was saved
from being mangled by the transformation. To finish off the
restructuring of her cranium, Luz’s skull tapered down and became
significantly more pointed.</p>
<p>For the final round of changes, Luz witnessed something that nearly
made her toss cookies. From her knees, elbows, and wrists, sharp-looking
curved blades made of pure bone erupted. Then, the transformation
completed by covering her entire body in scales, starting from her head
and spreading down the spine, finishing at the tip of her tail.</p>
<p>Luz was incredibly grateful that the shapeshifting process didn’t
come with any pain.</p>
<p>“So, how do I look?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Absolutely terrifying,” King answered, giving a thumbs up.</p>
<p>“Sweet! Nobody’s gonna mess with me,” Luz proclaimed, imitating those
poses she saw bodybuilders do on TV.</p>
<p>“Luz, why exactly are you a giant bladed snake creature?” Eda said,
coming in from the kitchen.</p>
<p>“I’m coming up with a scary demon disguise so I can go to the library
with Amity sometime over the weekend,” Luz explained.</p>
<p>“Huh, alright. You do you, kid. Look, I just checked the weather
report on the CB, and it’s gonna rain soon, so no going outside unless
you have a death-wish. Oh, and Luz?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Miss Eda?”</p>
<p>“Can you turn back into a human for me? I don’t want your claws
scratching the floor.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing, Miss Eda,” Luz said, morphing back into her human
form.</p>
<p>“Hey, Luz, I wanna show you something,” King said, tugging at Luz’s
now human arm.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Follow me,” King replied, letting go of her arm and scampering up
the steps all the way up to the attic, opening the door and quickly
shutting it before Luz could see what was inside.</p>
<p>Luz chuckled as she folowed along. She wondered what exactly she was
gonna see when she went in. Would it be a giant plushie fort? Or maybe
King wanted to show her his latest drawing. The diminutive demon did
occasionally refer to himself as the “King of Artists”.</p>
<p>Pushing the door open, Luz was completely thrown off by what she saw.
This was the last thing she would have expected.</p>
<p>The attic had been transformed into some kind of makeshift classroom.
A corkboard covered with a tarp sat on an easel, while a tiny school
desk was placed in front. Strung up on the walls was a diagram showing
the inner workings of Hooty. Luz was pretty sure that she could even see
a smaller, shorter Hooty inside the body of the main one, along with
rows of teeth lining the house demons insides. Luz shuddered at the
thought of there being multiple of Hooty. One was already more than
enough, but if there were even more? That would be a living
nightmare.</p>
<p>Making an educated guess, Luz crammed her way into the desk and faced
towards the tarp-covered board.</p>
<p>“So, what are we doing up here?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Basilisk Luz, you spent so much time yesterday learning about
witches and magic that you didn’t spend anytime learning about your own
kind. That is why you are here for...” King ripped the tarp off the
corkboard, revealing it to be packed with pictures of demons of all
shapes and sizes, “Demons 101!”</p>
<p>“Ooh, this sounds fun,” Luz said to herself.</p>
<p>“Demons like us are grim creatures of the night, living to spread
fear and anguish across the Isles. Our only weaknesses are purified
water and passive-aggressive remarks,” King continued.</p>
<p>“Aww, you guys have a soft side. Although, I’ve touched holy water
before, when I was baptized, and I didn’t get hurt by it.”</p>
<p>“Wait, really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Papa and I got baptized on the same day, actually.”</p>
<p>“One second.” King then pulled out a book that Luz hadn’t noticed and
began quickly scribbling in it. Crossing out the <em>All demons</em>, he
replaced it with <em>Most demons</em>. “There we go, now it’s
accurate.”</p>
<p>“Okay, <em>most</em> demons are susceptible to purified water and
passive-aggressive comments,” King said, resuming his lesson. “While you
and I are both fearsome warriors not to be trifled with, there are still
some demons we should be wary of. The most dangerous, though, is the
Snaggleback. Protected from the rains by its spiny shell, the
Snaggleback feeds on those who couldn’t find shelter. It especially
enjoys eating tourists who got trapped outside.” King flipped the pages
of his book and showed Luz a sketch of the Snaggleback.</p>
<p>“Ooh, that guy looks very spooky,” Luz said, admiring King’s fearsome
drawing of the creature.</p>
<p>Suddenly, lightning flashed in the distance and the resulting thunder
shook the house.</p>
<p>“Whelp, the rain’s here. I think we should call the lesson,” King
said, taking down the corkboard and folding up the easel, stuffing the
two in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>“I love the rain!” Luz exclaimed, running down the stairs and out the
door, but not before Eda yelled at her. “Hey, I said no going outside!
Do you want to be cooked alive?”</p>
<p>Luz obviously didn’t hear that last part. Kneeling down next to a
flower, Luz admired the plant. “I bet you’ll like the rain too, little
fella.”</p>
<p>The flower did not like the rain, apparently, getting struck by a
rogue raindrop, instantly withering and collapsing into dust.</p>
<p>“What the?” Luz cried out, scrambling away from the fallen plant.</p>
<p>“I told you to stay inside!” Eda yelled, dragging Luz back in the
house.</p>
<p>After ensuring everyone was inside, Eda let go of Luz’s arm.</p>
<p>“You didn’t get hurt, did you?” Eda asked, searching Luz for any burn
marks.</p>
<p>“I’m fine, Miss Eda,” Luz said, brushing away the witch’s hand.</p>
<p>“Good. You better not pull that stunt again, cause I might not be
there to save your hide,” Eda chastised the teen, crossing her arms and
giving a stern look.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Miss Eda. It won’t happen again, I promise.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Now that everyone is inside, I’m gonna go put up the
shields.” With that, Eda went back outside to brave the storm.</p>
<p>“Do it quick! The rain is getting close to my precious stucco!” Hooty
screeched.</p>
<p>Running over to a window, Luz peeked outside to get a look at Eda
working her magic (quite literally, in this case). The witch in question
first cast a small spell, giving her a sort of magical umbrelaa,
protecting her from the rains. Eda then walked forward a few paces
before turning to face the house and casting a much larger spell. A
giant orange bubble appearead around the house before shrinking down and
conforming to the exterior. Walking back through the force field, Eda
strutted confidently back to the house.</p>
<p>“Man, that took a lot out of me. That should keep us safe until the
storm blows over, though,” the witch said, entering the house.</p>
<p>“The weather here is so fun and interesting,” Luz said with a smile
on her face.</p>
<p>“Oh you haven’t seen anything yet, kiddo. We’ve got gorenadoes, shale
hail, painbows, fun stuff like that,” Eda said, counting on her
fingers.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna regret asking this, but what’s a painbow?” Luz said
squeamishly.</p>
<p>“It’s like a Human Realm rainbow, except looking at it turns your
body inside out!” King answered with a giggle.</p>
<p>Luz regretted asking.</p>
<p>She did <em>not</em> need that mental image.</p>
<p>“So, do we have any plans to wait out the storm, Miss Eda?” Luz
asked.</p>
<p>“Not really. We can do whatever, pretty much,” Eda responded.</p>
<p>“Hmm... Can we do some magic lessons? Mr. Bump at Hexside said that
you could probably teach me.”</p>
<p>Eda let out a groan. “Of course Bumpykins would put that idea in your
head. Alright, kid, we’ll do one lesson, okay? That’s it.”</p>
<p>“Got it,” Luz said, nodding.</p>
<p>“You said you learned about bile sacs and stufff while posing as that
kid’s homework, right?”</p>
<p>“Yup. Learned about ‘em in all their gory glory.”</p>
<p>“Well then, that will make this easier. Alright, let’s start with an
example. This is a light spell.” Eda then drew a large circle in the
air, which condensed into a ball of pure light upon completion. “The
larger you draw the circle, the more powerful the spell, and the more
magic it’ll take to complete the spell.” To emphasize this, Eda then
drew a much smaller circle, with the resulting tiny light ball
flickering out of existence after a few seconds.</p>
<p>“Woah. That is so cool. Can you do that again? I wanna record it this
time,” Luz said, reaching into her pocket and opening the
<em>Camera</em> app on her phone.</p>
<p>“Sure, kid. So ya see, the spell works by–” Eda suddenly collapsed to
the ground unconscious, not even getting a chance to finish the spell
circle.</p>
<p>“Oh no, Miss Eda!” Eda ran over to her fallen teacher and quickly
checked the witch’s pulse. It was still there, though it was going way
faster than what Luz considered normal.</p>
<p>Thankful for Mamá giving her some first aid training, Luz dragged
Eda’s body (which was way heavier than Luz expected) over to the couch
and situated the unconcious witch so that her legs were elevated about a
foot above her head. Checking for anything that could be constricting
blood flow, Luz luckily found nothing.</p>
<p>“Alright, hopefully that helps,” Luz said, taking a step back. “Now,
we just have to wait for her to wake up. I’m so sorry this happened,
Miss Eda,” Luz apologized.</p>
<p>“Has this ever happened before, King?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Never,” he responded.</p>
<p>“Okay, so that probably means that Miss Eda is running low on magic.
She did say that putting up the force fields took a lot out of her,
after all. Is there any, like, magic drink we can give her?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, but I’ve noticed that Eda always drinks this one
orange elixir every day that seems to give her a boost of energy in the
morning. Maybe we should give her some of that?”</p>
<p>“Hmm... That could work. Do you know where Eda keeps them?”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure she stores ‘em in her room.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go find some, then.”</p>
<p>After one last look at the Owl Lady, Luz ran up the stairs and made
her way into Eda’s room. King followed behind quickly, shutting the door
and turning on the light.</p>
<p>“Alright, where could it– Oh, there it is.” Luz’s eyes scanned the
room before quickly falling on the bright orange elixir laying on Eda’s
nestside table. (Luz thought it was a little odd to have a nest instead
of a traditional bed, but Eda was odd herself, so Luz just wrote it off
as Eda being Eda.)</p>
<p>A flash of lightning and a crash of thunder shook the house.</p>
<p>Grabbing the elixir, Luz examined it, seeing if there were any
instructions printed on the glass. There was nothing.</p>
<p>“Okay, magic in a bottle secured, now let’s–” Luz was cut off by the
lights suddenly going dark.</p>
<p>King ran over and gave the light switch a few flicks up and down,
only for nothing to happen.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Hooty controls the house lights. He probably just fell
asleep or something,” the tiny demon said.</p>
<p>“HOOT! OW! HOOT!” the house demon screamed.</p>
<p>“That does <em>not</em> sound like he’s asleep,” Luz said, dropping
the elixir and running down the stairs. In the back of her mind, Luz
heard the sound of shattering glass.</p>
<p>Upon entering the living room, Luz saw that the front door had been
knocked off its hinges and was laying on the floor. A creature stood in
the doorway, dragging a pair of claws along the door, leaving deep
gouges in the wood. Suddenly, there was another flash of lightning, and
by the time Luz could see again, the creature was gone.</p>
<h1 id="luz-accidentally-kos-a-crusty-old-woman">Luz Accidentally KO’s A
Crusty Old Woman</h1>
<p><strong>Kriegstag 3, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Running over to the downed bird tube, Luz knelt down and checked how
Hooty was doing. His eyes were closed, but peeling back an eyelid
revealed the eye itself to be shooting all around, in short random
movements. That was a good sign. Hooty wasn’t dead, just asleep.</p>
<p>Letting out a small sigh of relief, Luz took stock of her current
situation. Right now, the force field surrounding the house was still
intact, which meant that the mystery demon that attacked Hooty had
either passed through the shield without breaking it (Unlikely, Luz
thought, but she had to consider all the possibilities.) or the creature
was already inside when the shield was put up, which was an infinitely
scarier thought.</p>
<p>The demon that had just knocked out Hooty was <em>inside</em> <em>the
house</em> when the shield was put up.</p>
<p>Swallowing the lump in her throat, Luz turned to King.</p>
<p>“King, random question, but has this house ever had a... demon
infestation?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then how do we explain the thing that just KO’d Hooty?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a mirror flew through the eye-shaped window that was in
Eda’s room, and a loud screech could be heard from the freshly-broken
hole in the wall. Falling to the ground, Luz and King barely scrambled
out of the way before the mirror smashed into a thousand tiny pieces on
the ground.</p>
<p>“Well, now we know where the intruder is,” King quipped.</p>
<p>Ducking inside the house and pulling King along with, Luz finally got
a chance to get a good look at the current state of the living room.</p>
<p>To say it was a total mess would be a gross understatement. The couch
that Luz had propped Eda’s feet up on had been torn to shreds,
presumably by the intruding demon, and Eda herself was nowhere to be
seen. A variety of feathers and other things that were used as stuffing
for the couch’s upholstery were scattered all around the room. Some of
the feathers looked interesting, though. Luz knew that the down feathers
that were in the couch were pure white, but some of the feathers on the
ground were a much darker grey color and were also significantly
larger.</p>
<p>Luz quietly walked over and picked up one of the gray feathers. It
looked like it more belonged on an eagle or a hawk then in a couch. This
had to have been dropped by the demon that was currently in Eda’s
room.</p>
<p>Motioning King to come over, Luz crouched down and started discussing
her findings.</p>
<p>“Alright, so this feather probably came from the demon upstairs. Do
you know about any feathery demons that would kidnap people?”</p>
<p>King thought for a second before responding. “No, but there might be
something that could help in my demon book... which is upstairs, where
the thing that took Eda is.”</p>
<p>“Okay, so the demon book is a bust. Let me think,” Luz said, trying
to remember those little factoids that Mami had told her while she was
working on birds at the clinic.</p>
<p>“<em>See how his eyes are so close to each other,</em> mija<em>? That
indicates that he’s a predator. If his eyes were spaced out really far,
then that would mean he was more used to being prey for other larger
birds.</em>” Camila had said to the then 8-year-old Luz, who was more
focused on petting the red-tailed hawk than.</p>
<p>Luz was about 99% sure that the demon that attacked Hooty was a
predator.</p>
<p>“Ok, so this thing is about a foot taller than me, a quadraped, has
giant black eyes, and is probably some kind of bird-demon.”</p>
<p>“It has black eyes?” King asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, why?” Luz asked back, trying to see where King was going with
this.</p>
<p>“If I remember right, demons with big black eyes are usually really
susceptible to sudden bright lights.”</p>
<p>All of the sudden, a roar could be heard coming from Eda’s room, and
heavy footsteps stomped along the floor, sending dust and cobwebs
falling to the ground on the level below.</p>
<p>“Well,” Luz said, “If you can’t tell, we don’t have any lights at our
disposal.”</p>
<p>“What about that spell Eda was showing you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have a bile sac, remember? Plus, if I tried to morph one,
I’d probably, like, catch on fire or something.”</p>
<p>Luz got out her phone and pulled up the video of Eda casting the
spell, pausing it right when she completed the spell circle. Mimicking
the witch’s actions, Luz spun her finger around to no effect.</p>
<p>“See? Nothing,” Luz said for emphasis, sliding her phone in her back
pocket and taking a seat on the hard wooden floor.</p>
<p>A <em>CRUNCH</em> could be heard emanating from where Luz just sat
down.</p>
<p>Closing her eyes tightly, Luz let out a small, “Dang it,” and pulled
her phone back out to inspect the damage she had just caused in her
foolishness.</p>
<p>While the glass no had a large crack going down the center, Luz was
grateful for her screen protector doing its job and keeping the phone
still operable. Although, the picture Luz saw on her screen now was
different than the one she had seen just a few seconds prior.</p>
<p>Now, in the middle of Eda’s circle, there was a pattern. Luz blinked,
making sure the design was still there and she wasn’t imagining things
again.</p>
<p>Yup. It was real.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of Eda’s spell circle was what looked like some
kind of alchemy rune or something. It was composed of a circle inscribed
with a triangle that was bisected by a line emanating from the top of
the triangle that connected straight down to the circle. The bisecting
line had two small slashes on it, both of them going up and to the
right. Atop the triangle, but still within the circle, was a small
circle that was topped by an even smaller triangle.</p>
<p><em>It looks like a weird bow and arrow in a circle</em>, Luz
thought.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Luz remembered what Bump had said about witches of
yesteryear using a different method to cast spells.</p>
<p>Careful to not damage her phone anymore, Luz quickly but gently
placed her phone on the ground.</p>
<p>Scrambling into the kitchen, Luz tried to find a pen and something
she could write on. She found a pen in a drawer by the sink, but she
couldn’t find a real piece of paper, so she opted to grab a napkin
instead. That would be a good substitute for what she was about to
try.</p>
<p>Running back into the living room and taking her place in front of
her phone, Luz laid the napkin on top of the screen and began tracing
the design, thankful that she could see it through the napkin.</p>
<p>Starting with the outer circle, Luz made sure to get her recreation
as close to the original as she could. After wishing she had a compass,
she moved onto the big triangle and the bisecting line with its two
little friends. Finally, Luz finished by drawing the small circle and
the triangle it wore for a hat.</p>
<p>Confident in her drawing skills (Thanks, years of creating Hecazura
fanart!), Luz put the pen down and admired her handiwork.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath and closing her eyes, Luz waited for the magic
to happen. When nothing happened, she took a peek and saw the napkin
still sitting there, being incredibly non-magical.</p>
<p>Giving the napkin a small defeated tap, it suddenly crumpled into a
ball and turned into a floating ball of light.</p>
<p>Luz had just done magic.</p>
<p>She had just done magic <em>that didn’t involve hurting
people!</em></p>
<p>Gazing at the floating light, Luz’s eyes were filled with wonder.</p>
<p>“King, I’ve got an idea on how to stop that demon from hurting
Eda.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, what is it?”</p>
<p>“I’m gonna fight it.”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding? That thing’ll kill you! How are you gonna put up a
fight with that little light ball?”</p>
<p>“Who said that the light ball would be little? Also, how fast can you
run?”</p>
<p>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;</p>
<p>Luz had no idea if the plan would work. She’d been lucky to find a
thick marker that she could use to draw on the wall, but it was a little
bit harder to find a place to hide her hulking Kraugh body.</p>
<p>“AHH!” King screamed, peeling down the hallway at top speed, the
demon that took Eda hot on his tail.</p>
<p>The demon ran right past Luz, somehow not noticing the giant
serpentine monster she was.</p>
<p>Comingout of hiding, Luz staid a few paces behind the intruder. She
would need a running start if she wanted to take this thing down to the
ground.</p>
<p>Luz watched King dive, paw outstretched, barely grazing the glyph
drawn onto the wall. But that was all that was needed for it to
activate.</p>
<p>A giant bright light filled the hallway, and Luz finally got a good
look at the demon. It wasn’t the raptor-like appearance she had
expected, looking more like an owl-bear from Creatures &amp; Caverns.
The creature let out a loud screech and reared back onto its hind feet,
inadvertently turning to face Luz.</p>
<p>Luz took that as her signal and bullrushed the owl-thing, slamming it
to the ground in a vicious tackle, the beast’s head slamming against the
ground with a loud <em>THUD</em>. Waiting for a potential response, Luz
rose a clawed fist and was fully prepared to begin trading blows with
the demon.</p>
<p>When the demon didn’t move for a solid five seconds, Luz cautiously
climbed off its stomach. Quickly demorphing back into her human form,
Luz waved her hand in front of the unconscious intruder’s face.</p>
<p>“Woah, it’s out cold. Wait, we forgot about Eda!”</p>
<p>Running into Eda’s room, Luz looked for any sign of the witch.
Scanning the room, Eda was nowhere to be seen. Luz felt her eyes once
again drawn to the nestside table. It had been toppled over, and adrawer
that Luz hadn’t noticed before had fallen open, spilling its contents on
the grond. The contents: more of those glowing orange elixirs, although
a few of them had small tags attached to them.</p>
<p>Carefully stepping over the fallen debris and general pandemonious
that had occurred, Luz picked up one of the tagged elixirs and looked at
the tiny slip of paper.</p>
<p><em>An elixir a day keeps the curse at bay</em>, it read, accompanied
by a small pictogram of a red demon skull.</p>
<p>Luz slowly put two and two together. Eda drank these elixirs every
day. The elixirs that were made to stop one from succumbing to a curse
and, presumably, turning into a beast. The only way the “intruder” could
have been inside the house was if it could get through the shield. Eda
had walked through the shield after she put it up.</p>
<p>Luz had just knocked out Eda.</p>
<p>Holding onto the elixir, Luz ran back into the hallway and knelt down
next to <del>the demon</del> Eda’s head and gently opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“Luz, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“This is Eda, King,” was all Luz said, as she pulled the cork out of
the elixir and slightly raised Eda’s head, slowly pouring the liquid
down the witch’s throat.</p>
<p>As more and more of the elixir entered Eda’s system, the feathers
began to recede and her body slowly shrunk from that of the Owl Beast to
the Owl Lady. Luz was finally not the one on the receiving end of a
magical transofrmation, she realised, with a small laugh.</p>
<p>Once the elixir was all out and Eda was back to normal, Luz and King
teamed up to carry Eda’s still-unconscious downstairs and lay her as
comfortably as possible on the destroed-but-still-pretty-comfy
couch.</p>
<p>As the night progressed, Luz and King waited for Eda to finally
awaken. While doing so, though, Luz found an old little sketchpad and
began drawing copy after copy of that symbol she had seen on her phone.
With each drawing, tap, and subsequent ball of light, Luz’s eyes grew
wider and wider. This had to be the magic casting method that Bump was
talking about. Luz knew that this wasn’t all there was though. There had
to be more glyphs out there. Yeah, that was a good word for these
things. <em>Glyphs</em>.</p>
<p>“Ugh, my head is killing me,” Eda procalimed, rolling off the couch
and faceplanting onto the floor.</p>
<p>“What time is it?” She asked, slowly getting up to her feet.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t matter, look!” King said, pulling at the Owl Lady’s
pant leg and pointing at Luz.</p>
<p>“How is she doing that?” Eda asked, amazed at the sight.</p>
<p>“No idea, she just draws thes symbols on the paper and taps it and
boom, magic!” King exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Incredible. Hey kid, come over here!” Eda called out to Luz.</p>
<p>Luz quickly got up and ran over and wrapped Eda into a hug.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry, Miss Eda. I had no idea it was you, I swear. I would
never mean to hurt you. Please don’t be m–”</p>
<p>“Kid, kid, it’s fine. I’m okay. Just have a lil headache, that’s
all.”</p>
<p>“That’s such a relief. You’re head banged against the floor pretty
hard.”</p>
<p>“I. Am. Fine.” Eda disengaged from the hug before continuing, “Look,
I haven’t exactly been honest with the two of you. Back when I was a
teen, I got cursed. I’ve got no idea who did it, but I don’t care
anymore. I’ve got my elixir system, and as long as nobody messes with
it, we’ll all be fine and dandy. If someone does jank it up, though,
well... I guess you guys can tell why they call me the Owl Lady.”</p>
<p>Luz pulled Eda back into another hug, but this time, Eda begrudgingly
reciprocated the gesture.</p>
<p>“What! I don’t get a hug? This is blasphemy of the highest order!”
King said.</p>
<p>Luz quickly scooped King into the hug as well, squeezing tight. King
tried to squirm back out, but failed and accepted defeat.</p>
<p>“HOOT HOOT! I’M STILL OUT HERE! IT’S COLD, HOOT HOOT!”</p>
<h1 id="luz-reads-a-different-book">Luz Reads A Different Book</h1>
<p><strong>Kaufetag 3, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Bonesborough,
B.I.</strong></p>
<p>Luz slowly walked down the streets of Bonesborough. The claws on her
feet, courtesy of her current Kaugh morph, scraped against the rocky
sidewalks in a rhytymic fashion. Turning her head this way and that, she
finally got a chance to take in the sights and sounds and smells of the
town for the first time.</p>
<p>Her current destination was the Bonesborough Public Library, and she
still had a few minutes before she was going to meet up with Amity, so
Luz decided to do some sightseeing to pass the time. Luz could have made
a beeline to the library, but she didn’t want to show up at 10 on the
dot. That would make her look a little too eager to be there. Luz wanted
to look cool and stuff, so she was more than willing to show up a few
minutes late.</p>
<p>Today was market day, which meant Eda was probably hawking some
random items she stole from the Human Realm to whoever was buying. In
fact, Eda had asked Luz if she would be able to help her out at the
stand, but after Luz brought up that she already had plans, Eda relented
and dragged King along instead.</p>
<p>Checking a nearby crystal ball for the time, Luz saw that it was
9:57, meaning she still had some time to kill before heading to meet up
with Amity.</p>
<p>Slowing her pace, Luz took in all the things that were being sold
around her. To her left, a stand calling itself “Sir Chuck’s Fine
Die-ning” sold what appeared to be a combination of deep fried... orbs
and slabs of meat ranging in size from normal to outright gargantuan. On
her right, across the street, a cart advertised Not Dogs (Luz did
<em>not</em> want to know what was in those things.) for a snail a
piece. Further down, Luz could see other stands, with a few of them in
particular standing out amongst the rest. “Bread, Bats, and Beyond” had
an… interesting selection, to say the least, while “Ax’s Axes” sold what
one would expect.</p>
<p>Luz walked past all the stands, regretting not bringing any snails
with her. She would have loved to see what a Sin-A-Bun tasted like.</p>
<p>Checking the time once again, Luz found that it was now 10:04.
Approaching the steps that led up to the Bonesborough Public Library,
Luz took a deep breath and slowly exhaled. Grabbing the (surprisingly
light) door handle, Luz did her best to quietly enter the library, not
daring to disturb the sacred tranquility.</p>
<p>Making her way to the front desk, Luz walked up to the witch staffing
the area. The witch looked haf asleep and had a look on their face that
said “If you ask anything stupid I will throw you out myself.”
Cautiously approaching the librarian, Luz gave a small wave and said,
“Hi, I’m here to see Amity Blight. Do you know where she is?” in the
most friendly voice she could muster. Given her current form, she
probably looked like she wanted to eat a baby, but it was the thought
that counts.</p>
<p>The librarian didn’t even bother looking up from their desk, simply
responding with, “Kid’s Section,” and pointing to the left with their
thumb.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Luz replied, wakling off and looking to see if there
were any banners or signs indicating where the kid’s books would be.
Luckily, there were, with the banner Luz was searching for indicating
that Amity would likely be somewhere between the Romance and the
Reference sections.</p>
<p>Entering the area designated the “Kid’s Corner”, Luz looked around,
comparing this library to the one she frequented back home. Tacky
posters encouraging reading appeared to be universal across dimensions,
though this realm’s version had a much more morbid twist. The poster
showed a cartoony depiction of a witch (complete with green skin, wart,
and pointed black hat) being burned alive, with the caption reading,
“Get learned at the stake!” Aside from the strangely dark posters, the
décor of the area wsa generally very bright and cheery. A giant rug in
the shape of a cat’s head greeted Luz, with the fake feline sticking its
bright pink tongue out. A toy chest filled to the brim was open, with
even more toys strown to and fro across the floor. Oddly, there were no
actual kids playing with the toys.</p>
<p>“’What do you think you’re doing?’” Luz recognized Amity’s voice,
though it had an odd cadence to it. Following the noise and rounding a
corner, Luz found Amity surrounded by children. A mixture of witches and
demons all sat around the emerald-haired witch as she read them all a
book, showing them the pages as the story progressed.</p>
<p>Not wanting to interrupt story time, Luz simply leaned her back
against a nearby bookshelf and waited for Amity to finish.</p>
<p>“’We’re your friends and we want to help,’ said the Tin Boy, with a
yelp. Otabin smiled and paced the floor. ‘I’ve never had real friends
before,’” Amity continued, seemingly unaware of Luz’s presence, being
too <em>in the zone</em>, Luz assumed.</p>
<p><em>She’s reading to kids. That’s nice of her,</em> Luz thought,
smiling as Amity kept reading.</p>
<p>“’Then we'll be your first,’ the Chicken Witch clucked. Otabin
couldn't believe his luck. So, Bookmaker Otabin surrounded by friends,
bound a book of friendship and that's the end.” On that final note,
Amity stood up and tucked the book under her arm. The children
surrounding her applauded the performance, a few of them thanking her
and saying good-bye.</p>
<p>One child in particular caught Luz’s attention. They looked like a
shrunken down version of Warden Wrath. As the child gave Amity a hug, a
demonic sounding voice came out of their mouth. “Thank you, Miss
Amity.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Braxas. Have an awesome day!” Amity replied in an upbeat
tone, waving goodbye to the demon.</p>
<p>Amity looked up and finally made eye contact with Luz. Walking over,
the witch asked, “Hi there. Can I help you with anything?”</p>
<p>Luz let out an exaggerated gasp. “What? You don’t recognize me? I
thought we were so close, Amity,” Luz said sarcastically.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, am I supposed to know who you are?” Amity asked, a look
of confusion on her face.</p>
<p>“It’s me, Luz. I pretended to be Willow’s abomination, remember?” the
basilisk responded.</p>
<p>“Oh, right. You know, when I told you to come in a disguise, I didn’t
mean that you had to be completely unrecognizable. Just giving yourself
witch ears or something would have sufficed.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know, but I wanted to have fun with it.”</p>
<p>“Alright, well now that you’re here, let’s get down to business. So,
are there any specific topics you want to research regarding your kind,
like culture, biology, and stuff like that, or are you looking for more
general information?” Amity asked, leading Luz away from the kid’s
section and back towards the entrance of the library.</p>
<p>Luz pondered the question for a bit before responding, “I would say
to start with general and then maybe switch to more specific stuff if we
find anything interesting.”</p>
<p>Amity stopped in front of a wall that had rows of little faces on it,
each face belonging to a demon that was cube shaped and only had a mouth
and a single eyeball. Amity then stooped down to be level with the
faces.</p>
<p>“Where can I find information about basilisks?” Amity asked to one of
the faces. The face responded by lolling its tongue out, a small slip of
paper hanging off the end.</p>
<p>Amity grabbed the slip and read offf its contents. “597: Cold-blooded
beast demons. I think I know where that is. Follow me.”</p>
<p>Doing as she was told, the two researchers soon found themselves
standing before a ginormous bookshelf that reached up to the ceiling.
There appeared to be no order to the entries, with every book seemingly
placed in at random.</p>
<p>That would make this much harder, Luz realized. She’d have to get
super lucky if she could even find one book about basilisks in this
jumbled mess.</p>
<p>“Let’s hope we can find something quick,” Luz said, reaching out
blindly and grabbing a book. Looking at the cover, Luz was pretty sure
that <em>How To Train Your Yrch</em> wasn’t exactly what she was looking
for. Although, the slug on the cover that was slithering into a witch’s
ear looked slightly like Luz in her basilisk form if you squinted really
hard.</p>
<p>Putting the book back, Luz went to the next one in line. <em>The Ins
and Outs of the Selkidomus</em> was similarly of no help.</p>
<p>Luz kept moving down the row. <em>Jörmungandr – Fact or Fiction</em>
and <em>The Beauty of the Butterknifefly</em> also offered nothing of
use.</p>
<p>The next book Luz saw caught her attention, but not because it had
anything to do with basilisks.</p>
<p>“Hey Amity, I think this book might be in the wrong section,” Luz
said, holding out the copy of <em>Lady Wanda and the Missing Witch’s
Wool</em>.</p>
<p>Amity grabbed the book and stared at the front cover, letting out a
frustrated sigh. “Ugh, I swear I’m gonna dump a cauldron full of the
stickiest abomination goop I can find on the twins.”</p>
<p>“The twins?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“My older siblings, Edric and Emira, think it’s the funniest prank in
the world to mess with the books here knowing full well I’ll get blamed
for it. Knowing them, they’ve probably messed with dozens of books.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t sound like a prank, that sounds like just being mean
and making you do lots of extra work.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well that’s their idea of hilarious.”</p>
<p>“Well forget them, then. By the way, have you found anything yet? So
far I’ve got nothing,” Luz said, trying to steer the conversation away
from the sore topic.</p>
<p>“Nope,” Amity replied.</p>
<p>“Darn. Guess we just have to keep looking and we’ll find something
eventually.”</p>
<p>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;</p>
<p>“Hey Amity, I found something,” Luz said, tapping the witch on the
back and showing her <em>On the Origin and Situation of
Basilisks</em>.</p>
<p>“Great! Do you want to keep looking, or is just this one fine?” Amity
asked, motioning to all the remaining books that were yet to be looked
at.</p>
<p>“Based off the title, this one will probably be enough,” Luz said,
before quickly adding on, "So, if I wanted to read this here, do I have
to check it out or anything, or can I just sit down at a table and open
it up?"</p>
<p>“If you’re going to read it here then you’re fine, but if you wanted
to take it back to the Owl Shack then you’ll have to get a library card
and check the book out for 2 weeks.”</p>
<p>“So it’s just like back home, sweet. I’ll stay here and read, then.”
With that, Luz sauntered over to an empty table and sat down in one of
the unoccupied chairs, Amity soon joining her, sitting beside the
basilisk.</p>
<p>Examining the book cover, it was very similar to Eda’s cryptozoology
book, with the front of the book only bearing the title and the name of
the author. Based off the author’s name (Esplin the Lesser) and how
yellowed the pages were, this book had to be ancient.</p>
<p>Slowly opening the book up, Luz and Amity noticed that all of the
pages were handwritten and bound by needle and thread. Careful not to
damage the fragile pages, the two began reading.</p>
<p><em>Let it be known that I, Yosephus Esplinius Fenestra, younger
sibling to the famed Allorinius Esplinus Corrass, have compiled these
records, documenting the likely origins of basilisks here in the Boiling
Isles. During my research, I have also found numerous other points of
interest regarding the basilisk population, of which many have been
archived in these pages.</em></p>
<p>Luz let out a long exhale. While <em>Good Witch Azura</em> would
occasionally become flowery in its prose, it was usually limited to the
dialogue of certain characters. This, however, seemed to be page after
page of nonstop pretentious writing.</p>
<p>Luz skimmed through the pages, most of the content being things she
already knew or had experience with, though she stopped when she reached
a section labelled <em>The Grand Registry</em>.</p>
<p><em>During my travels through the basilisk settlement of Pemal, I
heard whisperings of parents taking their newborns to a place referred
to as the Grand Registry. When I asked a local about what exactly the
registry was, they responded that it was where an infant child would be
taken to have a small sample of their blood collected, as well as have
the child’s names, both</em> Dralag <em>and common, recorded. When I
inquired about why the registry required the blood of the newborn, the
civilian refused to speak with me anymore.</em></p>
<p><em>My intrigue piqued, I questioned another passerby, seeing if they
knew where exactly one could find the registry. They told me that it lay
near the heart of the Titan. Based on my estimations, that would be at
least three days of travelling by foot, though if I could gain
possession of one of those new “palismans”, then the trip would be much
quicker.</em></p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, I could not come into possession of a palisman, so
I had to make the journey on foot. After travelling without much
incident, I managed to stumble, by pure happenstance, upon a roving band
of basilisks who were also going to the registry. Luckily, they allowed
me to join their party.</em></p>
<p><em>The Hamee family, as they were called, were taking their youngest
child, Jara (n.b.: I believe that to be the child’s name, though the
thick accent the family spoke with means the child could have a name
counter to what I have recorded) to have him entered into the registry.
During our travels together, I asked the family about why the Grand
Registry had been established, and they informed me</em></p>
<p>Luz’s eyes flicked over, ready to read the next page, though the page
her eyes landed on was completely different from what she expected,
talking about something called <em>the Escafil Process</em>. Looking
closer, Luz realized that at least a dozen pages had been removed from
the book, with the small slivers of paper still bound to the book being
the only evidence. The cuts were very smooth, like someone had taken a
pair of scissors or some other blade to the book to eliminate the
offending pages.</p>
<p>“Huh, weird,” was all Luz could say to the tampering.</p>
<p>“Well, that isn’t good. I’m going to have to report this to Malphas
and see if he can do anything about this,” Amity added.</p>
<p>“I’m guessing Malphas is your boss?” Luz said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, and he is not going to be happy that someone damaged one of
the books. He treats them like they’re his children.”</p>
<p>“My librarian back home was like that too. He was the best," Luz
thought back to when she first met Mister Grine. He was one of the
nicest people Luz had ever met, always encouraging her to follow her
passions. He even contributed to her Good Witch Azura addiction, letting
her know when the newest book was in stock so she could check it out
ASAP. "Do you think it would be okay if we kept reading? I want to see
if there’s anything else that’s interesting,” Luz asked after waiting a
beat.</p>
<p>“As long as we don’t damage the book any more then it already has
been, then I think we should be in the clear,” Amity replied.</p>
<p>“Sweet!” Luz said, diving back into the faded yellow pages.</p>
<p><em>The Escafil Process</em></p>
<p><em>While staying in a small village near the head of the Titan, I
met a member of a local healer’s guild who was kind enough to offer me
one of their books regarding the thaumaturgical process in which
basilisks shapeshift. As I am no thief and don’t want to steal the
credit for other’s work, if one would like a more thorough explanation
than I can provide here, then seek out Seerow of Fangor and you shall
not be disappointed.</em></p>
<p><em>In short, though, the shapeshifting process (Seerow also referred
to it as the Escafil process, so that name may also be used in certain
circles) works by taking the magic that basilisks have stored in their
stomachs and absorbing it into the bloodstream of the demon through
small cilia-like appendages that line the inner walls of both stomachs.
This magic-rich blood is then pumped throughout the body, where a spell
similar to that of a corporeal full-body illusion is then cast, altering
both the outside appearance of the basilisk, as well as the innards, to
match whatever form the basilisk chooses.</em></p>
<p><em>I guess you learn something new every day</em>, Luz thought.</p>
<p>Turning the page to see what crazy fact was next, Luz found the
majority of the ink to be smudged, rendering the text illegible. She
could make out a few words, though “kindness” and “reprobate” weren’t
that much to go off of. Checking the remaining pages, Luz only found
smears of ink more suited to a Rorschach test then a book.</p>
<p>“Whelp, I guess the universe just doesn’t want me to learn more about
my species.” Luz said, admitting defeat and closing the book. She then
cupped her chin with her hands and let out a long sigh.</p>
<p>Getting up from her chair and grabbing the book off the table, Amity
shook Luz by the shoulder. “Come on, we should get this over to Malphas.
He’ll know what to do with it.”</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s go then.” Luz said, slowly rising to her feet.</p>
<p>The two then maneuvered their way to a large wooden door with the
words <em>Master Librarian</em> emblazoned on it. Knocking thrice, Amity
waited for her boss to emerge from his study.</p>
<p>With a shout of “I’m almost there, give me a second,” Malphas opened
the door, garbed in a large cloak and a pair of comfy-looking
slippers.</p>
<p>“Oh, hey Amity. How are ya doing? Also, who’s your buddy?” The
bird-like demon said, looking over at Luz, who stood behind and to the
side of Amity, trying her best to be inconspicuous.</p>
<p>“I’m doing well, Mal. This here is Luz, and I’m helping her out with
some research. The thing is, while doing so we found out that this
book,” Amity held out the damaged item, “has been tampered with and is
falling into disrepair.”</p>
<p>Malphas took the book and gave it a look over, slowly flipping
through the pages. “Well, this has certainly seen better days. Thanks
for letting me know, Amity. I’ll be sure to see what can be done with
this poor soul.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Mal.”</p>
<p>“No worries, Amity. Now, I’d love to keep chatting, but I’ve got some
work that I have to attend to, so I’m going to have to cut our talk
short.”</p>
<p>“Alright, Malphas. Have a good day!”</p>
<p>“You too, Blight.” At that, Malphas retreated back into his study and
shut the door.</p>
<p>“That guy seemed pretty chill. I can see why you like working for
him,” Luz said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, he’s a great boss. He treats everyone fairly and with respect,
which is better than I can say for some people,” Amity replied.</p>
<p>“Have you had experience with cruddy bosses?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you don’t even wanna know.”</p>
<h1 id="luz-learns-about-the-magic-of-camaraderie">Luz Learns About The
Magic Of Camaraderie</h1>
<p><strong>Kaufetag 4, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>“’Your reign of terror is over, Gildersnake!’ Azura proclaimed,
pointing her magic staff at the beast. The Spell of Exile was her last
hope to defeat the wretched creature. With a shout of
‘<em>Vertreibe</em>!’ and a blast of magic, the Gildersnake was
vanquished, never to harm the citizens of Hruthin ever again.”</p>
<p>Luz closed her copy of <em>The Good Witch Azura: The Darkness Strikes
Back</em> and looked down at King, eyes staring up at her with a look of
wonder.</p>
<p>“So, what do you think?” Luz asked, gauging the demon’s reaction to
the ending of the novel.</p>
<p>“It was so filled to the brim with mushy fantasy drivel that it was
actually good,” King replied, climbing to his feet amongst his
collection of plushies.</p>
<p>“I’m guessing you liked it, then? Oh, and look at the little flipbook
I drew.” Luz opened the book back up and showed King the tiny drawings
she had made in the margins. As she flipped the last few pages back and
forth, a drawing of Azura fired a blast of magic from her staff,
striking the Gildersnake, and causing it to explode into dozens of tiny
pieces.</p>
<p>King laughed at the drawings. “Hah! I can do better than that. You
know, as the King of Artists, I was renowned for my unmatched skill when
it came to drawing things exploding. I was the best!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the portal door appeared, opening to reveal Eda and Owlbert
walking through the divide between realms. Behind him, Owlbert dragged a
giant burlap sack stuffed to the brim with random items from Luz’s
neighborhood.</p>
<p>“All right freeloaders, it’s market day. That means we’ve got to set
up shop early before someone steals my spot,” Eda said, grabbing the
sack from Owlbert and slinging the human goods over her shoulder.
Reaching down, she then scooped King up with her free arm. “Come on,
let’s go!”</p>
<p>The streets of Bonesborough were quieter than normal for this time of
day. Usually, there would be a constant droning in the background of
hundreds of voices screaming, all trying to get passersby to buy
whatever item they were peddling. Luz didn’t mind the quiet, though, as
it allowed her to re-read <em>The Good Witch Azura:</em> <em>Revenge of
the Gildersnake</em> without constantly being interrupted by something
trying to eat her.</p>
<p>As Luz turned the pages, she couldn’t help but occasionally run her
fingers over her now-pointed ears. Sure, she could have gone out as the
Kaugh, but that transformation took a lot of magic to pull off. Magic
that, while overly abundant given her being in a realm full of
magic-filled witches and demons, she didn’t feel right taking from
others.</p>
<p>Except for Warden Wrath. He could step on a colorful interlocking
plastic brick for all she cared.</p>
<p>So pointed ears on an otherwise human Luz it was. Heck, she looked
like an actual witch now! (Even if she didn’t have the awesome outfit
that Azura always wore.)</p>
<p>“Where is everybody?” Luz asked, looking up from her book. <em>Human
Collectibles</em> was the only stand around. “Are they all playing hide
and seek or something?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea, kiddo,” Eda answered, shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<p>Just as Luz was about to return to her book, two sets of footsteps
could be heard running up to the stand. Looking up, Luz saw that it was
Willow and Gus who were the guilty party.</p>
<p>“Hey, Willow! Hi, Gus!” Luz greeted the two, closing her book and
hopping over the table.</p>
<p>“Luz, where have you been? We’ve been looking for you all day,” Gus
said.</p>
<p>“I’ve been at the Owl House, and then we came here at 9. Like we do
every market day,” Luz replied matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>“Oh. Right,” Gus said.</p>
<p>“See? I told you she wasn’t at the all-you-can-beat buffet,” Willow
interjected.</p>
<p>“So, why were you guys looking for me?” Luz said, wondering what
could get the two of them so excited.</p>
<p>“Well, we wanted to invite you to come to the Covention with us,”
Willow answered. “There’s even going to be a mystery guest this
year.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, that sounds fun. But, what’s a Covention?”</p>
<p>“It’s where students from all the magic academies go to look at every
coven there are before they get placed into one after graduation.”</p>
<p>“So it’s like a magical career fair? That’s awesome!” Luz said,
elated at the prospect that she could see all the different types of
magic. “Eda, can we go?”</p>
<p>“What? Absolutely not! Coventions are where fun goes to die and all
the happiness gets squashed out of you while you get turned into a
stooge for the Emperor.” Eda responded flatly, crossing her arms and
standing her ground.</p>
<p>“Please, Miss Eda? It will be so cool and magic-y,” Luz said, doing
her best puppy-dog eyes and batting her eyelashes. She held the look for
a few seconds before Eda finally relented.</p>
<p>Eda let out a long groan. “Fine, we’ll go to the Covention. Just stop
doing that face. Its cuteness is making me sick.” She paused for a bit
before continuing. “Besides, I might as well see how the Emperor is
brainwashing you fools nowadays. Haven’t been to one since we were
kids.”</p>
<p>Luz perked up. “’We’? Who’s ‘we’?”</p>
<p>Before Luz could question her anymore, Eda cut her off by saying,
“That doesn’t matter. It happened a long time ago and isn’t important.
Let’s just get this over with.”</p>
<p>Grabbing Owlbert and magicking away everything non-essential, Eda
stomped off towards the Covention hall, with the kids following quickly
behind.</p>
<p>The gang of witches, Luz, and King stood huddled in a dark corner
outside the Covention. Eda wrestled with a cowl, trying to force her
mountain of hair to fit into the hood. Luz did her best to help,
stuffing the remaining locks into the hood with a little assistance from
King.</p>
<p>“Why do we have to do this, again?” Luz asked after Eda managed to
tuck the last strand into the cowl.</p>
<p>“To keep a low profile. Do you think I’m wanted just for
pick-pocketing bozos on the street?” Right as Eda said that, a cascade
of small trinkets and accessories fell out of her hair, clattering to
the floor. “Mostly.” Scooping up some of the fallen objects and placing
them back in her hair, she continued. “But the thing that has really got
the Emperor’s knickers in a twist is that I refuse to join a coven. So
that’s why I need the cowl. I need a disguise. I don’t want to go to
jail.” She stopped to count on her fingers. “For the fourth time.”</p>
<p>“Well, maybe seeing all the wonders of the coven system could
persuade you to join one,” Willow said hopefully.</p>
<p>Eda laughed and let out a snort. “Hah! Fat chance that’ll happen,
kid.”</p>
<p>Now donning a completely fool-proof disguise, Eda and the others
entered the Covention.</p>
<p>As the group walked through the main foyer of the hall, Luz could
barely keep her jaw from plummeting through the floor. <em>This place
looks amazing!</em> she thought, taking in all the sights. Rows upon
rows of booths filled the hall, all of them advertising one coven or
another. Above her head, student witches flew by on broomsticks. She
also couldn’t help but notice the giant banners hanging from the
ceiling. She counted 9 in total, each of them with its own distinct
color and logo.</p>
<p>Gus noticed Luz looking towards the banners and jumped in with an
explanation. “Those are for each of the nine main covens: Healing,
Plant, Beast Keeping, Oracle, Construction, Bard, Illusionist,
Abomination, and Potions. There are hundreds more to choose from,
though. You just have to find which one suits you best.”</p>
<p>“Woah,” was all Luz could respond with.</p>
<p>Picking a row at random, the group walked past all the booths that
had been set up. As they did so, Willow named off even more covens that
a witch could join. “There’s Scrying Coven, Baker’s Coven, Acting Coven,
Debate Coven, Tiny Cat Coven–”</p>
<p>Eda groaned from the back of the group.</p>
<p>“And how could I forget the Grumpy Coven?” Willow continued without
missing a beat.</p>
<p>“You wanna repeat that?” Eda said, disgruntled at the remark.</p>
<p>Willow let out a yelp as she ran away from the annoyed Owl Lady, with
Luz, Gus, and King following close behind.</p>
<p>As the gang neared the end of the row, they turned back around, just
in time to see Eda throw a small blue bag in some random witch’s face
before yanking their hood over their head. As the Owl Lady ran over to
meet back up with the kids, Luz saw the <em>cutest</em> little fox
creature she’d ever seen.</p>
<p>The fox-like demon was seated on a stool, postured in a very proper
manner. It stood at roughly the same height as a child, and it was
dressed in a sleeveless gray tunic, torn-up brown shorts, and dark brown
boots. Luz could also see that the demon had a mess of auburn hair and
burnt orange fur.</p>
<p>Luz couldn’t help herself. She ran over as fast as her legs could go
and began petting the absolutely adorable demon. While it was initially
hesitant to the sudden contact, it relented, giving in to the affection.
The demon’s fur was surprisingly smooth and silky, Luz realized.
Switching tactics after a few seconds and rubbing her finger under the
demon’s chin, it let out a small yawn.</p>
<p>“Luz, stop that! That’s Eberwolf. He’s the head of the Beast Keeping
Coven,” Willow said, chastising Luz for her behavior.</p>
<p>“But he’s so cute!” Luz rebutted, now giving Eberwolf head rubs.</p>
<p>“Yes, and he can also have you thrown in the Conformatorium. Let’s
check out the other covens.”</p>
<p>“Fine. Bye Mr. Eberwolf!” Luz said, waving goodbye, which the demon
enthusiastically matched.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a light-blue clone of Luz popped into existence behind her,
peeking over her shoulder. “Bye Mr. Eberwolf!” the clone repeated,
before running over to another booth and vanishing into a nonexistent
wind.</p>
<p>“Woah, what was that?” Luz asked, astounded.</p>
<p>“Ahh. I see you’ve been drawn in by the wonders of the Illusionist
Coven,” Gus said, “We enjoy magic with a hint...” He disappeared in a
puff of smoke, only to reappear a few steps away, “of pizzazz.” He
finished with a bow as two other coven members poofed behind him, each
flanking a side.</p>
<p>“Acceptance? Camaraderie? A sense of belonging and not feeling like
an alien?” Luz couldn’t believe what she was seeing. “Covens sound like
a dream come true! Why haven’t you ever joined one, Eda?”</p>
<p>“Are ya sure about that, kid? Watch closely,” Eda said, motioning
towards another teenage witch who had been swooned by the flashiness of
the Illusionist Coven.</p>
<p>“When you fall for the bait and join a coven, all your other magic
gets locked away.” A blue sigil appeared on the pimply-faced witch’s
wrist as a light blue color spread through their veins. “Now, all that
kid can do is illusions. Nothing more, nothing less,” Eda explained.</p>
<p>She then summoned a fireball in one hand and an orb of water in the
other. “And that is why Emperor Boo-los has me as Public Enemy #1, and
why I’m also <em>the</em> most powerful witch on all of the Boiling
Isles.” She dispelled the two spheres with a wave of her hand.</p>
<p>As the group walked away from the Illusionist Coven, Willow and Gus
listed off coven after coven, each of them getting progressively more
specific. At some point, King had been lured away from the group and he
was currently AWOL. He was probably being promised dark deeds done in
his name or something silly like that.</p>
<p>“Of course, the People-Who-Look-Like-Doppelgängers Coven is a very
rare coven to get in to,” Willow said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but it’s even harder to qualify for the Dross-Detecting
Coven,” Gus countered.</p>
<p>The gang, sans King, approached a doorway flanked on both sides by
guards. Above the door, a banner hung depicting two pairs of wings and a
sword on top of a triangular shield. Luz couldn’t help but think she had
seen a design similar to that back in Gravesfield. She was pretty sure
she had seen something similar on the town welcome sign. Coincidences
happened all the time, though, and this was probably no different. It
was a relatively simple design, after all.</p>
<p>Gus gasped. “I can’t believe the Emperor’s Coven is actually here
this time! Do you think I can get an autograph?”</p>
<p>“I guess we’ll have to go and find out,” Willow replied, and the two
young witches ran into the theatre.</p>
<p>Luz moved to follow after her friends, but slowed up when she noticed
that Eda hadn’t moved from her spot.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to join us, Eda?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not. The Emperor’s Coven is just a bunch of yes-witches
for Bonehead. They’re the worst of all the covens. I’m fine waiting out
here,” Eda replied.</p>
<p>“I get it. Conformity: bad. Self-reliance: good. But, I’m also still
learning all the ins and outs of this world, so I’m going to be making
my own choices and that includes whether or not I join a coven. I’m
going inside, alright?” Luz then turned and walked into the theatre.</p>
<p>After Luz found a good seat in one of the upper bowls and had sat
down, Eda rushed over and plopped down in the seat next to the
basilisk.</p>
<p>“Hey kid. Changed my mind. I want to see this hot mess go down.”</p>
<p>Just as she finished saying that, the lights surrounding the theatre
dimmed.</p>
<p>It was time for the show to begin.</p>
<h1 id="luz-gets-forced-into-a-death-battle">Luz Gets Forced Into A
Death Battle</h1>
<p><strong>Kaufetag 4, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Covention
Hall</strong></p>
<p>Luz could barely contain her excitement, doing everything she could
to not just jump out of her seat and yell for the show to begin.
Practically vibrating from all the pent up energy, she resorted to
bouncing her knee up and down and tapping her feet.</p>
<p>“You good, kiddo?” Eda asked, turning to the teenager.</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry. I’ll stop. I’m just excited, that’s all.” Luz responded,
stopping her foot mid-tap.</p>
<p>“Well, that makes one of us.” The Owl Lady said with a grumble.</p>
<p>Luz looked around the theatre, trying to find Willow and Gus, but she
couldn’t see them anywhere. Hopefully they had gotten better seats then
her. She was in the mother of all nosebleed seats, positioned in one of
the highest rows, barely able to see the stage at the center of the
theatre.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a huge cloud of smoke appeared on the stage, and out of the
pyrotechnics emerged Hieronymous Bump. Summoning a microphone, the
principal began speaking.</p>
<p>“As a principal, I’ve seen many witches and demons walk the halls of
my school. While some students may have gone the ordinary route of
joining one of the main nine covens, or even specializing in a smaller
coven, there are a few outliers. There are a few students who go above
and beyond what is expected. Through academic excellence and an
upstanding character, a select few of my students have been accepted
into the Emperor’s Coven. Tasked with enforcing the will of our great
Emperor, members of his coven act as the stabdardbearers of society.
There are quite a few perks that come with being a member of the
Emperor’s Coven, as well.”</p>
<p>A collection of Emperor’s Coven scouts emerged from the floor,
adorned in cloaks and their signature beaked masks. Each scout then drew
a spell circle, causing balls of fire, water, abomination goop, and rock
to appear.</p>
<p>“When you become a member of the Emperor’s Coven, you have access to
all, and I do mean <em>all</em>, types of magic, with no restrictions
whatsoever. But, I don’t think you all came here to listen to an old
witch talk about his job, so now, for the moment you have all been
waiting for. The mystery guest for this year’s Covention is the head
witch of the Emperor’s Coven herself, Lilith!”</p>
<p>A giant white illusion of a raven swooped down to the stage from out
of nowhere, before dissapating and revealing a tall witch dressed in a
simple black dress with similarly long black hair. Luz couldn’t help but
notice the similarities this Lilith lady had with Eda. Both of them
shared a lot of features, most noticeably being the pale white skin.
Lilith stepped forward and Bump moved to the side, allowing her command
of the stage.</p>
<p>“Greetings, witches and demons. Although Hieronymous has given an
adequate description of the prerequisites for joining the Emperor’s
Coven, he has forgotten to mention one thing. Prospective members of the
Emperor’s Coven must also prove themselves to be knowledgable in all
aspets of spellcasting while also being powerful enough to cast
exceptionally taxing spells.”</p>
<p>“Does this count as powerful?” A member of the audience yelled,
before drawing a spell circle. Luz didn’t know what to expect, but she
certainly didn’t expect for the student’s head to enlarge to a size more
fitting of a giant, only to topple over and crush the other student next
to them. A sickening <em>CRACK</em> echoed throughout the theatre.</p>
<p>“No. Will someone contact a member of the Healing Coven for this poor
witch?” Lilith stated flatly. “As I was saying beofre I was interrupted,
the final requirement for joining this prestigious coven is to showcase
a mastery of numerous types of magic, both in theory and in
practice.</p>
<p>“If you don’t show the mastery right away, but have the potential and
are simply in needing of training, then that training shall be provided
to you while you work for the coven. I will leave you with this: joining
the Emperor’s Coven, while challenging, is more than worth it. So, be
more! The Emperor’s Coven awaits you!”</p>
<p>With a spread of her arms, Lilith summoned the white raven and looked
over the crowd. Her eyes moved from student to student, until she locked
her gaze onto the Owl Lady. A mix of anger and sadness shown on the
coven head’s face as she stared at her sister.</p>
<p>Luz noticed Eda’s surprised look. “Do you know her, Eda?” Luz asked,
turning to the witch.</p>
<p>“I guess you could say that.” Eda replied, eyes still locked on her
sister.</p>
<p>Eda stormed out of the theatre, going as fast as she could without
drawing too much attention to herself. Luz ran up to the witch.</p>
<p>“Eda, where are you going?”</p>
<p>“I’m getting out of this Titan-forsaken building. I need to go back
to the house and wash the smell of Emperor bootlicking off.”</p>
<p>“What? That’s insane! We haven’t even gotten a chance to check out
all of the covens yet.”</p>
<p>Eda simply grunted and started walking even faster. Shrugging her
shoulders, Luz turned around, only to walk straight into Amity, knocking
both of them to the ground.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry. I should’ve watched where I was going,” Luz said,
climbing to her feet and offering her hand to the fallen Blight.</p>
<p>“No worries. I’m fine.” Amity replied, grabbing the hand and pulling
herself up. The lavender-haired witch found her eyes drawn to the
basilisk’s ears, which were noticeably pointed, not unlike her own.</p>
<p>“Good idea giving yourself witch ears. A human walking around the
Covention would have definitely drawn some unwanted attention,” Amity
continued.</p>
<p>“Thanks. This is way easier than doing a giant, bladed snake-monster.
Plus, it’s not as taxing on my magic reservoirs.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been wondering: how exactly do your... magic reservoirs work?
Do you have to, like, drain a witch every other day or you go
crazy?”</p>
<p>“To be honest? I’m not 100% sure. The only people I’ve ever drained
are Warden Wrath and Principal Bump, and I haven’t had, like, a hunger
attack or anything, so I think as long as I have had some magic in the
past few weeks, then I should be good.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. That’s interesting.”</p>
<p>“Amity, I’ve been looking for you.” Amity and Luz turned to see
Lilith approaching them quickly.</p>
<p>“Oh, hello Miss Clawthorne. I thought you would still be busy with
coven business.” Amity said, bowing her head slightly.</p>
<p>“Today’s the Covention, so I used my one day off to allow myself some
leisure time today. Plus, I knew you’d be here, so I thought I’d check
up on my protégé and see how her studies were doing.”</p>
<p>“My studies are going well, Miss Clawthorne. Top Student, as per
normal, with the highest marks in every class.”</p>
<p>“I expected onthing less, Amity. Keep up your grades an you’ll
undoubtedly become a member of the Emperor’s Coven one day.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Miss Clawthorne.”</p>
<p>“And who might you be?” Lilith turned to Luz. “I don’t think I’ve
seen you before.”</p>
<p>“Luz Noceda, Miss. Nice to meet you.” Luz offered a handshake, being
sure to follow those lessons she had learned from cotillion.</p>
<p>“I see that manners aren’t a completely foreign concept to witches
your age. Thak the Titan.” Lilith replied, giving Luz a solid
handshake.</p>
<p>“This might be a weird question, but are you related to Eda the Owl
Lady?” Luz asked, hoping to answer the question that had been bouncing
around in the back of her mind.</p>
<p>“Yes, Edalyn is my sister, ironic as that may seem. May I ask why you
want to know?”</p>
<p>“Well, Eda has been my sort of landlord, sort of teacher for the past
few weeks.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, are you telling me that Edalyn has taken you on as her
apprentice?” Lilith’s face grew worried.</p>
<p>“Pretty much, yeah.” Luz responded.</p>
<p>Lilith squatted down to be at eye-level with Luz and grabbed her
shoulder lightly. “Child, take this advice to heart: stay far, far away
from Edalyn. She is incredibly dangerous, both to herself, and to
others.”</p>
<p>“Luz, there you are!” The trio of Luz, Amity, and Lilith turned to
see Eda walking over, King hoiseted upon her shoulder, smearings of what
looked like cupcake frosting covering his mouth, with dozens of trinkets
and accessories draped over his person.</p>
<p>“Hello, Lilith.” Eda said, her normally snarky demeanor replaced with
a cold, exact one.</p>
<p>“Hello, Edalyn. I see you’ve still taken to dressing in garbage.”
Lilith looked Eda’s outfit up and down.</p>
<p>“The only garbage here is the propaganda you’re spewing to these
kids.”</p>
<p>“I’m helping the people of the Isles follow the will of the Emperor,
and by extension, the Titan itsef. Are you telling me that I shouldn’t
be following what the Titan wants. In fact, I’m even training the next
generation of witches, and what are you doing? You’re probably teaching
her how to rob a witch blind or some heinous activity like that.”</p>
<p>“I’ll have you know that Luz here could absolutely destroy any of
your stuck-up little mini-mes.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that you are a better teacher than me? Fine. Let’s
put that to the test.” With a spin of her finger, Lilith destroyed all
of the WANTED posters that had Eda’s face on them. “For the rest of the
day, your bounty is voided. In an hours time, your apprentice will face
my protégé in a Witch’s Duel. Use that time to prepare however you see
fit. Shall we set the conditions?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Eda responded. “If Luz wins, you have to... buy me a
lifetime’s supply of apple blood and get rid of my bounty forever.”</p>
<p>Lilith laughed at Eda’s requests. “Of course, and if Amity wins, then
you’ll have to join the Emperor’s Coven immediately.”</p>
<p>Eda grimaced at what would happen if Amity won, but stuck her hand
out. “Let’s make it official then. Everlasting Oath and all that.”</p>
<p>“Gladly,” Lilith replied, drawing a spell circle around Eda’s wrist
before shaking hands. “The Everlasting Oath is sealed.”</p>
<p>Luz and Eda sequestered themselves into a derelict corner of the
Covention hall, with the closest booth being far out of earshot. King
had once again ran off, but they both knew he would be alright. He was
too cute to be seriously injured.</p>
<p>“So, how does this ‘Witch’s Duel’ thing even work? I doubt it’s like
how they are in <em>The Good Witch Azura</em>.” Luz asked, wringing her
hands nervously.</p>
<p>“Well, a traditional Witch’s Duel is between two witches and ends
when one of them beefs it. Pretty much all magic is allowed, with the
sole exception of autonecromancy. That one defeats the whole ‘to the
death’ part. Everything else is fair game, though. Oh, and getting help
fom outside sources is also not allowed. But everything that you have
naturally at your disposal can be used.”</p>
<p>“So that means...” Luz started.</p>
<p>“That you could drain the Blight kid of all her magic and it would be
totally legal? Yup!” Eda said cheerfully.</p>
<p>“What? No! Why would I want to do that? I don’t want to have to kill
anyone!” Luz yelled.</p>
<p>“Oh, well why didn’t you just say that.” Eda deadpanned.</p>
<p>“That’s what I was trying to–” Luz let out a groan. “Ugh. How do we
get out of this duel thing wihtout anyone dying?”</p>
<p>“The only way a Witch’s Duel ends before one a combatant’s death is
when one or both of the parties are found to be cheating while the Duel
is in progress,” Eda answered.</p>
<p>“And since I can’t exactly resurrect myself, I’m guessing the only
way I can cheat is through outside interferrence?” Luz said dourly.</p>
<p>“Ya got it in one, kiddo,” Eda replied with a grin.</p>
<p>Luz jogged in place at on edge of the theatre floor, stationing
herself opposite Amity and Lilith. Stopping every so often to stretch
out her muscles, she hoped everything went to plan. If not, well, Luz
didn’t want to think about what would happen if the plan failed.</p>
<p>“So all I have to do is to avoid Amity for a while and then get her
to step on one of these little mounds of dirt? Then I’ll get DQed and
Amity will win with nobody dying?” Luz asked, making sure she knew
exactly what to do.</p>
<p>“Pretty much, yeah. And be sure to sell you being surprised by the
trap. That’ll make it super obvious that you’re getting help,” Eda
said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Luz let out a deep breath and readied herself. Across the
floor, she saw Lilith and Amity having a brief discussion, with Lilith
being oddly touchy with the young witch, especially around the back of
her neck. Amity looked nervous, and rightfully so.</p>
<p>Lilith stopped talking to Amity and walked to the center of the
floor, where Eda soon joined her.</p>
<p>“Citizens of the Isles, you are here to stand witness to a Witch’s
Duel. The conflicting parties are myself, Lilith Clawthorne, and my
sister, Edalyn Clawthorne. We shall not be fighting directly, and will
instead be represented in the Duel. My representative will be Amity
Blight, heir apparent to Blight Industries. Edalyn’s representative will
be Luz Noceda, some witch she probably kidnapped. Other than that,
standard Duel rules apply. No help from non-combatants, and no
self-resurrection. This Duel will end when one of the combatants is
killed. The only way this Duel will end early is if one of the
combatants is found to be cheating. If so, the Duel will be immediately
stopped, and the cheating party will be ruled the loser. The wagers are
as follows: if Amity wins, Edalyn will be immediately inducted into the
Emperor’s Coven, and if Luz wins, then Edalyn will receive a lifetime’s
supply of apple blood and have her bounty permanently voided.”</p>
<p>Luz did her best to ignore the chanting of the crowd, trying to block
out the noise and focus on the duel.</p>
<p>Across the floor, Amity gave a small wave and a smile.</p>
<p>Taking one final breath, Luz steeled herself.</p>
<p>Lilith raised her hand, palm open, and held it for a second before
slicing downwards.</p>
<p>“Let the Duel commence!”</p>
<h1 id="luz-nearly-curses-out-a-coven-head">Luz Nearly Curses Out A
Coven Head</h1>
<p><strong>Kaufetag 4, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Covention
Hall</strong></p>
<p>Lilith Clawthorne, despite what her sister would claim, was not a
fool.</p>
<p>Just an hour before, she had walked on the ground that her protégé
was now fighting on. Before her and Hieronymous’ presentation, the
Construction Coven had been entrusted with making sure that the stage
was in perfect condition, and that included a perfectly level flooring.
Now, though, small mounds were scattered along the ground. Mounds that
Lilith knew were there for a purpose.</p>
<p>Lilith shook her head and clicked her tongue. Of course Edalyn would
resort to such blatant cheating. Though her sister’s mockery of the
ancient rules was undoubtedly in character for the younger Clawthorne,
Lilith was still astounded she would go about it in such an obvious
manner.</p>
<p>Lilith was cheating as well, though. The two competitors had to be on
a level playing field, after all, so if Edalyn was going to bend the
rules, then Lilith would begrudgingly follow suit. Given, she was
cheating in a more elegant manner, if that was even possible. Before the
duel had begun, Lilith had stealthily placed a power glyph from the
Construction Coven on the back of Miss Blight’s neck. This would allow
the young prodigy to cast far more powerful spells than normal, but it
came at the cost of using up her magic much faster as well.</p>
<p>Well, that wasn’t the only reason Lilith was also cheating in this
Duel. She had let her competitive fire get the best of her when she had
coerced Edalyn into the Duel. Ever since the two of them had been
children, they had always been competing, either with each other or as a
team against a common opponent. On the Grudgby field they had formed a
formidable duo, leading Hexside on a winning streak that still had yet
to be matched. When they weren’t teammates, though, they were still
fierce competitors, even over the most trivial aspects of life. Lilith
still fondly remembered the day that she had finally bested Edalyn in a
game of Hexes Hold ’em. There was nothing on the line that game. There
were no stakes, yet the joy she felt when she played the winning hand
was second-to-none.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also some moments where Lilith regretted having
such a drive to win. There were some things that she wished she had
never sought out, decisions she wished she had never made. Decisions
that had ruined Edalyn’s life.</p>
<p>That was why Lilith was cheating. She knew what would happen if
Edalyn was inducted into the Emperor’s Coven. Yes, she would be cured of
her curse, just as Emperor Belos had promised, but she would also be
trapped. The Owl Lady would never submit to being locked in the cage
that is the Emperor’s Coven. Edalyn’s free spirit and need to cause
chaos wherever she went would never fit in among the ranks.</p>
<p>Lilith loved her sister. Yes, she may have gone against every law on
the books by refusing to join a coven, but Lilith would rather
fruitlessly chase after Edalyn until the end of days than see her in the
cloak of a scout.</p>
<p>So, as Luz Noceda and Amity Blight prepared to face each other,
Lilith prayed to the Titan that this vacuously-conceived Duel would end
with no victors and only a pair of cheaters.</p>
<p>Luz had no idea what to do.</p>
<p>Sure she had been in a few fights before, but she was exclusively on
the receiving end of the attacks, never the offensive. Mamá had always
told her that violence was never the answer to your problems, so Luz
would always weather the minute or two the fight would last, doing her
best to dodge the attacks. Eventually, the fight would be broken up by a
teacher and both Luz and whoever was on the other end would get
punished.</p>
<p>This fight was different though. If things didn’t go exactly as
planned, somebody was going to end up on a one-way trip to the nearest
morgue. That wouldn’t happen. That <em>couldn’t</em> happen. Luz would
make sure of it.</p>
<p>Old habits die hard, though, so as Amity summoned an absolutely
<em>massive</em> abomination, Luz stood frozen in place. She would let
the emerald-haired witch attack first and then do her best to lure her
onto one of the (hopefully obvious enough) traps.</p>
<p>The giant abomination suddenly ripped its head off and tossed it at
Luz. Thankfully, the head seemed to travel in slow motion as Luz’s
fight-or-flight instincts kicked in. Diving out of the way of the flying
projectile, Luz tried to scheme up a way to get out of this fight with
nobody dying.</p>
<p>Amity threw attack after attack at the basilisk. Luz ducked under a
punch from the abomination and threw one of her own. Her fist went
directly through the abomination's stomach, leaving a hole in the goop
monster’s abdomen.</p>
<p>Then Luz got an idea. She remembered how Willow had said that
abominations were essentially immortal and impervious to being hurt.
That meant that if she got one of Amity’s abominations to step on one of
the traps, then it would be set off and then the duel would be over
because Eda cheated and everyone could go back home and forget this ever
happened. That was a good plan, right? Well, at least it was a plan.</p>
<p>Noticing a nearby trap, Luz made a beeline to put the mound between
herself and the abomination. As the magical construct slowly ambled
towards her, it made the mistake of stepping directly on top of the
trap. A blast of fire sprouted from the ground, setting the abomination
aflame. Unfortunately, though, the abomination was still alive, and it
was now a flaming abomination trying to kill Luz.</p>
<p>The flaming abomination pressed Luz back up against the wall.
Seemingly out of good options, Luz did the only thing she could think
of. Diving between the abomination’s legs and scrambling away as fast as
possible, Luz tried to put as much distance as she could between herself
and the mindless killing machine.</p>
<p>Quickly getting back to her feet, Luz stole a glance to see how Amity
was doing. The witch looked shockingly pale, and she was sweating
profusely. Still though, she kept the spell circle holding the
abomination together active, although the circle was warping and
shifting, as if Amity was struggling to hold it.</p>
<p>Turning back to the abomination, Luz saw that it was still dead set
on sending her to an early grave. The abomination was still on fire, but
it was moving slower now, its steps sluggish, arms dangling at its
side.</p>
<p>Then the abomination stepped on a trap and exploded.</p>
<p>The explosion rocked the room, the <em>Ka-BOOM</em> echoing off the
high ceiling of the theatre. Bits of abomination goop was flung
everywhere, most of it still on fire. Crowd members scattered, dodging
the flaming balls of goop as it rained from the sky.</p>
<p>Luz was thrown on her rear-end as a result of the trap going off. As
she waited for her ears to stop ringing and the giant clouds of dust to
settle, Luz saw Amity on the other side of the floor. The witch was
barely able to stay on her feet. She staggered forward a few steps
before collapsing to the ground face-first.</p>
<p>“Oh my God, Amity!”</p>
<p>Luz ran over to the fallen witch, careful to avoid setting off any of
the traps. As Luz got closer, Amity seemed to regain a little strength,
having enough energy to push herself up to be resting on one knee,
though she did so through labored breathing.</p>
<p>“Amity, are you okay?” Luz asked, hoping she would get some kind of
answer. She offered Amity her hand, which the witch took.</p>
<p>“I’m exhausted. I didn’t know I could pull off a spell that big,”
Amity said between breaths as she got back on her feet.</p>
<p>“CALL OFF THE FIGHT!” Luz yelled to Lilith.</p>
<p>“This Duel will continue until only one of you is alive.” Lilith said
coldly, but the wavering in her voice betrayed her.</p>
<p>“You said this could end if one of us cheats though, right? Well
then, I cheated! Is that what you wanted to hear? All of this was from
Eda’s traps. I’m a filthy, no-good cheater. Are you happy now? The Duel
is <em>over</em>. You win, congrats.” Luz threw her arms up in
desperation as she ranted.</p>
<p>Lilith took a slow and controlled breath. It was time for her to
reveal that she was also guilty.</p>
<p>“Actually. I cheated as well,” she said simply.</p>
<p>“What? Oh there is a certain four-letter word that I really want to
call you right now.” Luz interjected.</p>
<p>“Miss Blight, please examine the back of your neck.”</p>
<p>Amity slowly felt around, moving her ponytail out of the way.
Suddenly, her fingers ran over a section that didn’t feel anything at
all like her skin. Finding the edge of the section, she pulled at it,
feeling a sort of adhesive tugging as she removed the offending object.
As the magic holding it to her neck gave way, Amity looked at what she
held in her hand.</p>
<p>“That is a power glyph from the Construction Coven. I placed it
during our talk just before the Duel began. I am so, so sorry, Amity. I
let my emotions get the best of me, and I apologize. I never meant for
you to get hurt.” Lilith bowed her head, staring down at the ground.</p>
<p>Amity could barely respond. She stared at the thin piece of paper in
her hand. She had cheated. Amity Blight, the best witch in all of the
Abomination Track, former star of the Hexside Banshees, and overall
perfect student, had cheated.</p>
<p>She dropped the glyph and ran.</p>
<p>“Amity!” Luz ran after the fleeing witch.</p>
<p>Luz threw open the doors of the theatre, looking around to see if she
could see a trace of emerald hair. She saw a flash of it turn a corner
off in the distance, so she followed and hoped Amity didn’t have some
secret body double.</p>
<p>Luz found Amity seated on the cold, linoleum floor and sat down next
to her.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Luz started.</p>
<p>“What? Have you come here to gloat or something?” Amity replied, her
voice breaking.</p>
<p>“No, I swear. It’s just… I’m sorry. I know that probably doesn’t mean
much, though.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well is that apology going to restore my chances of getting
into the Emperor’s Coven? I cheated. They don’t take cheaters.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know if you noticed, but we both cheated in the Duel,
which means we both lost. We can be, like, Loser Buddies or
something.”</p>
<p>That last remark got a small giggle out of Amity.</p>
<p>“That sounds like a comic that Ed would buy,” the witch said with a
laugh.</p>
<p>“We’d be the worst superheroes ever. ‘How will the Snakeshifter and
Emerald Enchantress battle their way out of this sticky situation? Find
out in the next issue of <em>Loser Buddies</em>!’” Luz did her best
impression of one of those cartoon narrators, putting on a crazy accent
for extra effect.</p>
<p>Amity guffawed. “I’m sorry, ‘Emerald Enchantress’? That’s an awful
name.”</p>
<p>“What, can you think of anything better?” Luz questioned.</p>
<p>“I… err… uh… no,” Amity stuttered out.</p>
<p>“Then Emerald Enchantress it is,” Luz said.</p>
<p>“Fine,” Amity replied begrudgingly.</p>
<p>The two sat silently for a moment before Luz remembered
something.</p>
<p>“Say, Amity, do you want to see some magic?”</p>
<p>“Sure? But don’t you not have a bile sac?”</p>
<p>“Nope,” Luz replied simply, pulling out her notepad and pencil. “I
don’t need one.”</p>
<p>She quickly sketched out the light glyph, having the design already
memorized thanks to countless repetitions over the past few days. She
tapped the glyph with the eraser-end of her pencil and watched the paper
crumble up into a ball, before turning into a sphere of pure light.</p>
<p>Amity looked at the floating light with amazement in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Incredible. I’ve never seen a spell cast like that before. How did
you figure that out?”</p>
<p>“It’s a long story,” Luz explained, drawing out the ‘o’. “There was a
storm, and Eda turned into the Owl Beast, and I cracked my phone, and…
Let’s just say that I’m really happy I can draw a perfect circle.”</p>
<p>“Are there any other spells you can cast with your little drawing
thing?”</p>
<p>“Nope, the light spell is the only one I’ve found so far. There’s got
to be others, though.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bell chimed three times, loud enough to echo through the
entire Covention Hall.</p>
<p>“Oh crud, I need to get going.” Amity said, quickly climbing to her
feet. “I have to prep for one of Mother’s presentations, and I can’t be
late this time. Bye Luz!”</p>
<p>As Amity ran off, Luz waved goodbye, even though the youngest Blight
wouldn’t see it.</p>
<p>“Bye, Amity,” Luz said quietly.</p>
<p>“Hey, kiddo. Whatcha doin’ back here?” Eda asked. Luz looked up and
met eyes with the Owl Lady.</p>
<p>“Amity and I, we were, uh, chatting.”</p>
<p>“Sure, kid. Well, let’s find King and bounce.”</p>
<p>The two did eventually find King. When they finally caught him, the
tiny demon was in the middle of huge group of Covention-goers, all of
them fawning over the demon.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right. If you join the King Coven, you get to give me
an hour of tummy scratches each day for the low cost of 5 thousand
billion snails,” King proclaimed.</p>
<p>“King! What are you doing?” Eda shouted, forcing her way through the
crowd.</p>
<p>“I’m being a good business-demon, like you,” he replied, clambering
his way on top of a nearby table to get away from the crowd.</p>
<p>“Everybody scram!” Eda yelled.</p>
<p>The crowd scrammed.</p>
<p>“Really King, you think they’re all gonna give you 5 trillion snails
a day? That’s more than my bounty, you goofball. If you’re gonna scam
‘em, don’t do it so blatantly.”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying I should give them a discount of 5 thousand
snails?” King asked hopefully, hopping down form the table.</p>
<p>Eda chuckled. “Yeah, that’s totally what I’m saying. Now let’s go.
This place reeks of conformity.”</p>
<p>As the trio walked out of the Covention Hall, Eda pondered the idea
of having her own coven.</p>
<p>“Ya know, the Eda Coven does have a nice ring to it. Wait, no, even
better, I’ve got it. How do you two want to be inaugural members of the
<em>Bad Girl Coven</em>?”</p>
<h1 id="luz-throws-a-mediocre-three-person-party">Luz Throws A Mediocre
Three-Person Party</h1>
<p><strong>Kaufetag 1, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>“Pay attention, kiddo. Hexes Hold’em is one of the most complex games
on all of the Isles, but it’s also one of the most popular. Any creature
worth their weight in Selkigris knows how to play,” Eda explained,
setting her deck on the table. Owlbert, who was perched across from her,
did the same.</p>
<p>“So how do you play?” Luz asked from her spot on the couch.</p>
<p>“Well, the long and short of it is that you’ve got two main types of
cards: lands and spells. Land card give you bile for certain Humors,
which can then be used to cast spell cards. Each player gets a certain
amount of health, usually 20 bits, and whoever drops to 0 health first
wins.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so it’s just like <em>Hocus-Pocus: The Get Together</em>.” Luz
said excitedly. Back in the Human Realm, she was the founding member of
Gravsefield High’s <em>Hocus</em> club. She was also the only
member.</p>
<p>“I have no idea what that is, but sure.” Eda replied flatly. “Now,
let’s see what my hand is.” Eda drew 7 cards at random from her deck. A
mischevious smile grew on her face. “Ooh, momma likes this.”</p>
<p>Owlbert then drew his 7 cards and let out a satisfied trill.</p>
<p>Eda went first, placing down <em>Titan’s Knee</em> and casting
<em>Raging Fairy</em>.</p>
<p>Owlbert countered, putting down <em>Hidden Waterfall</em> as his land
card and attacking with <em>Gore-nado</em>.</p>
<p>The game was afoot.</p>
<p>Luz watched on, enraptured, as the two battled it out on the coffee
table. Eventually, Owlbert’s forces had nearly overtaken Eda’s, leaving
the Owl Lady with only three health left. The palisman had a smug look
on his face as Eda’s attack opportunity rolled around.</p>
<p>“Now, kid, when your opponent thinks their victory is assured, that’s
when you pull out your wild card.” Eda pulled a card from her hand and
slammed it down onto the table and all of Owlbert’s cards were instantly
incinerated. The fire then coalesced above the tble, turning into a
message that read “WINNER: EDA”.</p>
<p>“Haha, yes! In your cute little face!” Eda gloated, jabbing a finger
at her palisman. Owlbert responded with an annoyed hoot and flared his
wings, hopping off the coffee table.</p>
<p>“I love the feeling of victory. Say, have you guys seen any voles
recently?” Eda said, collapsing onto the couch and draping her arms over
Luz and King.</p>
<p>Suddenly, feathers sprouted from the Owl Lady’s arms, with more
popping up from the neckline of her dress. Distressed, Luz jumped to her
feet and yanked King into her arms.</p>
<p>“Eda, you’re a little more… feathery than normal,” King said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? I took my elixir this morning. At least, I think I
did.” Eda summoned a mirror and looked for herself.</p>
<p>“Oh this isn’t good.” Eda said, getting off the couch and running
into the kitchen. She bgean throwing all the cabinets and drawers open,
looking for the golden liquid that would placate her curse. There were
none to be found. Running up the stairs and looking in her nest-side
chest had similar results. Luz and King entered the room as she closed
the chest.</p>
<p>“Well shi-” Eda’s eyes flew to King. “-itake mushrooms, I’m all out
of elixir. Let’s hope Morton’s stocked up. Come on, kids, we’re going to
the market!”</p>
<p>&lt;hr/&gt;</p>
<p>Eda banged on the grate to the <em>Mr. Elixir</em> stand. “MORTON! I
know you’re in there! Open up before I get hungry for <em>Langue de
Nerd</em>!”</p>
<p>“Just a minute, Eda.” A voice weakly called through the grate.</p>
<p>Luz, once again donning pointed ears, and King took a seat at a
nearby bench, with Luz taking in all the wonderful oddities that lived
on the Isles.</p>
<p>Luz let out a content sigh. “Ahh, is there anything better than
people watching, King?”</p>
<p>“Hmm.” King tapped his claw against his skull, thinking long and hard
about the question. “Conquering my enemies and bathing in their blood?
But beside that, no.”</p>
<p>Luz looked across the street, where she saw three witches waiting at
what looked like a bus stop. Suddenly, a massive egg fell from the sky
and cracked open upon smashing against the ground. From the remains of
the shell, a cavalcade of demons and witches emerged, hopping out and
walking away as if nothing was out of the ordinary. Given, this was the
Boiling Isles, so it was ordinary. The three witches who were waiting
carefully climbed into the shattered egg, only for it to magically
reconstruct itself and start rolling away.</p>
<p>“Wait for me!” A shrill voice cried out. Luz turned to see the
conspiracy theorist from the Conformatorium running towards the egg,
only to accept defeat and slow to a walk.</p>
<p>“Oh the curse of tiny legs.” Luz said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>“Yeah, being tiny sucks.” King added.</p>
<p>“But if you weren’t so tiny and adorabl, I wouldn’t be able to do
this.” Luz said, wrapping King up in a surprise hug.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Let me go you heathen!” King cried out.</p>
<p>A long, loud screeching sound assaulted Luz’s eardrums. She turned
around to see that the <em>Mr. Elixir</em> stand was now open for
business, and the namesake Mr. Morton Elixir was barely out of his
teenage years.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the hold up. I was up all night testing a new Liquid
Courage potion, and I’m not feeling the best.” The apothecary
apologized.</p>
<p>“Well sorry to break it to you, but I’m all out of elixir. I need a
fresh batch ASAP,” Eda said.</p>
<p>“I’ll see what I can do.” Morton said, retreating into the back of
his stand. The sound of bottles clanging together could be heard seconds
later.</p>
<p>Luz tooke the opportunity to do some more people watching. As she
scanned the pedestrians that walked around, her eyes landed on two very
familiar faces.</p>
<p>Running from the stand and over to her friends, Luz greeted Willow
and Gus.</p>
<p>“Hey, guys! How’s it going?” When the two didn’t reply, Luz noticed
the dour looks on their faces. “Wait a minute, what’s wrong? Who do I
have to go defend your honor against?”</p>
<p>“Them,” Willow said, jerking her thumb towards a group of young
witches that Luz didn’t recognize.</p>
<p>“Boscha’s having a moonlight conjuring, and she’s invited everyone
but us,” Willow explained with a frown.</p>
<p>“Plus, she keeps posting about it on her Penstagram account,” Gus
added, summoning his scroll and showing the announcement post to
Luz.</p>
<p>“’Conjuring Night 2nite! No dweebs, dorks, or half-witches allowed!’”
Luz read. “What a jerk!” She paused when she realised she had no idea
what the event actually was. “Hold, on what <em>is</em> a moonlight
conjuring?”</p>
<p>“Well, you spend the night at someone’s house, and you tell stories,
you play games, stuff like that.” Willow replied.</p>
<p>“So it’s like a slumber party! We have those back in the Human Realm.
I never got invited to one though.” Luz responded.</p>
<p>“And then there’s the main event: bringing something to life with the
power of the moon!” Willow said excitedly.</p>
<p>“And there’s the twist. Should have seen that coming, honestly,” Luz
replied.</p>
<p>“Willow and I have never been to one. You need at least three
people-” Gus said.</p>
<p>Luz gasped. “I can be the third person. We’ll definitely have more
fun than them. They probably hate having fun.”</p>
<p>“Hey Half-A-Witch! Are you still looking for an invite? Too bad
you’ve got no talent, then you might have gotten one,” the triclops
bully said.</p>
<p>Willow growled and small vines burst through the ground. Luz yelped
and batted at one of them. “Hey, don’t take your repressed anger out on
them. Take it out on, like, a punching bag or something. You know what?
Let’s stick it to those snobs by having our own moonlight conjuring,”
Luz said.</p>
<p>“Really? That means I’ll finally be able to cross off something on my
bucket list!” Gus said, his face lighting up.</p>
<p>“What else is on your bucket list, Gus?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Owning a genuine human bucket. I want to store all my human
treasures in it.”</p>
<p>“Well, I can probably find one in this week’s haul. You can have it
for free.”</p>
<p>“Awesome!”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’m gonna go check with Eda and see if she’ll okay us doing
the conjuring at the Owl House.”</p>
<p>Luz ran back to the Mr. Elixir stand to find Morton, Eda, and King
talking about the night market.</p>
<p>“Hey Eda!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, kid?”</p>
<p>“Willow, Gus, and I want to do a moonlight conjuring tonight and we
want to do it at the Owl House. Can we do it, please?” Luz made sure to
look as cute as possible while asking, batting her eyelashes and folding
her hands in front of her.</p>
<p>Eda contemplated for a moment. She knew the kid was pretty
trustworthy, and it wasn’t like she and her buddies would be able to
animate the entire house or something. Eh, what was the worst that could
happen?</p>
<p>“Sure kid, just don’t do anything that I would do at a conjuring.
Besides, I’m gonna be doing some very not safe stuff tonight and I need
you to watch the house, so your pals can tag along as long as they don’t
break anything important.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Thank you so much, Eda. I won’t let you down, promise.”</p>
<p>Willow and Gus ran up to Luz, hoping to hear good news.</p>
<p>“So is the conjuring gonna happen at the Owl House?” Gus asked.</p>
<p>“Yup! Eda gave us the go ahead as long as we don’t break anything,”
Luz answered with a grin.</p>
<p>“Sweet!” Willow said.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna do a conjuring! We’re gonna do a conjuring! Conjuring!
Conjuring!” Willow and Gus chanted in a sing-songy voice.</p>
<p>&lt;hr/&gt;</p>
<p>As night rolled around at the Owl House, Luz glanced nervously at the
moon. She had played far too much <em>The</em> <em>Legend of Grizel:
Borrindo of Space</em> last year, and this moon looked eerily similar to
the one in the game. Hopefully this moon wouldn’t crash into the Isles
and end life as she knew it. That would kinda suck.A sudden voice
snapped her out of the trance.</p>
<p>“Luz, I’m heading out. Let your friends in when they show up, don’t
destroy the house while I’m away, and please, for the love of the Titan,
don’t let Hooty eat anything he’s not supposed to.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got it.” Luz replied, giving the Owl Lady a salute. “Hey, uh,
where’s King?”</p>
<p>“He’s right here.” Eda said, opening her cloak to reveal a sleeping
King strapped to her in a bright pink baby carrier. King let out a small
snore. “His body just shuts down when he’s like this. Watch this.”</p>
<p>Eda move from side to side and King didn’t even make a noise as his
body flopped around like a ragdoll.</p>
<p>“Aww, he’s like the world’s cutest little puppet.” Luz said, lifting
and dropping one of his feet.</p>
<p>“Alright, we’ve really got to get going. Remember, kid, you can have
fun with your friends, just don’t do anything crazy, <em>capisce</em>?”
Eda said, opening the door and stepping outside, with Luz following
suit.</p>
<p>“Mmhmm. Loud and clear. Have fun breaking the law!”</p>
<p>“You know it. Ok, byeee!” With that Eda flew off to the night market.
Luz waved goodbye for a few seconds before turning to head back
inside.</p>
<p>Suddenly, two bushes that Luz hadn’t noticed exploded, only to turn
into Willow and Gus, both of whom were now dressed in regular
clothing.</p>
<p>“Holy mother of Titan!” Luz screamed at the loud noise. “Oh, its just
you two. You couldn’t have given me a warning? I think I’m deaf now,
thanks.”</p>
<p>“Blame Gus. It was his idea,” Willow said immediately.</p>
<p>“What, you think I wasn’t going to do a super cool dramatic reveal?”
The illusionist replied.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well I would have thought it was cooler if my ears weren’t
ringing,” Luz said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>“Sorry.” Gus said, looking down at the ground.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” Luz assured him. “Let’s just go inside and set up the
conjuring stuff.”</p>
<p>Luz escorted the two into the living room.</p>
<p>“So, we’ve got all your moonlight conjuring needs handled. We’ve got
snacks, we’ve got items from the Human Realm, we’ve got-”</p>
<p>Gus gasped. “A BUCKET!” The young witch ran over to the pile that was
the week’s haul from the Human Realm and yanked out a plastic
bucket.</p>
<p>“And the best part is is that we actually have enough people to do a
conjuring!” Willow added. “I just know this is gonna be great.”</p>
<p>“I never asked, how does this conjuring stuff actually work?”</p>
<p>“Well, you first have to figure out what you want to animate,” Willow
explained. “Since this is our first one ever, I think we should animate
something important. Do you have any super meaningful things from the
Human Realm?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got a picture of me and my mom. Would that count?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’d be perfect. Go get it. Be fast, though. The moon will
be in position any second now.”</p>
<p>Nodding, Luz ran up the stairs, two at a time. Opening the door to
her room, she spotted the framed picture atop her dresser. Grabbing the
photo, she turned to head back down the stairs.</p>
<p>As she did so, though, the moon shifted into position. Rays of
moonlight, imbued with the magic that only a celestial allignment could
provide, shone through the window.</p>
<p>One of those rays struck Luz. As if she had been shot, the basilisk
collapsed to the ground, the picture flying from her hand and the glass
shattering.</p>
<p>A bloodcurdling scream echoed through the halls of the Owl House.</p>
<h1 id="luz-discovers-a-new-hatred-for-the-moon">Luz Discovers A New
Hatred For The Moon</h1>
<p><strong>Kaufetag 1, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Luz’s body was on fire. At least, that’s what it felt like. She had
never been on fire before, but this was probably really close. Scratch
that, actually. Her history teacher, Mr. West, had set a few strands of
her hair on fire to wake her up during a lesson before, but that didn’t
hurt that much. Given, it was her first class of the day and she had
fallen asleep because she had stayed up all night watching Good Witch
Azura AMVs instead of doing her homework, so it was a tiny bit warranted
so that Mr. West could lecture without her snoring like a foghorn.</p>
<p>This hurt even worse than the threat of <em>la chancla</em>, though,
so Luz screamed, slamming her eyes shut and curling into the fetal
position.</p>
<p>The pain was unbearable. It was if every cell in her body had been
dunked in hot sauce and then thrown in an oven at 350 degrees. Luz tried
to crawl her way out of the moonlight that was causing this torture, but
she could barely find the energy to do so. As Luz forced her eyes open
so she could see, she noticed that her arms had gone from human to
basilisk. Reaching a hand out, she sunk her claws into the floorboards
and pulled with all her might, managing to drag herself a few inches
before trying again.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to do that, though, Willow and Gus had run up
the stairs to help out their distressed friend.</p>
<p>“Oh my Titan, what happened?” Gus asked.</p>
<p>“Moon,” Luz forced through gritted teeth. She was doing her best not
to swear up a storm.</p>
<p>Springing into action, Willow ran over to the window and drew the
curtains closed, casting the room into near-total darkness, the only
light coming from the fairy lights Luz had “stolen” from a collection
run and strung up with Eda’s help.</p>
<p>Slowly, the pain subsided. Luz propped herself up on her elbows and
breathing heavily. Gus knelt down next to her.</p>
<p>“Hey, copy what I’m doing,” he said, before taking in a long breath.
As he did so, he raised a finger for each second he was inhaling. Then,
he exhaled at the same rate, lowering the same fingers.</p>
<p>He then did it again, Luz mimicking his actions this time. As she
slowly exhaled, she felt way more calm than she had seconds prior.</p>
<p>“Woah, where did you learn that?” Luz asked as her breathing levelled
out.</p>
<p>“It was a little trick Willow taught me when we first met,” the
illusionist responded.</p>
<p>“And I learned it from my dads,” Willow chimed in as she tied the
window curtain closed.</p>
<p>“Huh, that’s neat,” Luz responded, orienting herself in a more
comfortable position given her current basilisk form.</p>
<p>“So, what exactly happened? We just heard you scream really loud,”
Willow asked.</p>
<p>“I’m, uhh, not exactly sure. Like, I was getting the picture, and
then the moon shined through the window, and I felt like I got stabbed
with a super hot fire poker or something,” Luz explained.</p>
<p>“Do you think it has anything to do with the celestial alignment?”
Gus followed up with.</p>
<p>“I dunno, probably?” Luz said, shrugging her shoulders. She then
remembered the reason she was up here to begin with. Clambering over,
she slowly picked up the picture of her and her mom.</p>
<p>The glass in the frame had completely shattered, with the largest
crack going straight down the middle, right between Luz and Camila. Luz
frowned at the state of the frame. She remembered when that picture was
taken. That was the day that Mamá had been promoted to Head Veterinarian
at the Happy Pets Clinic. Luz had known that that day was a big one for
her mom, so Luz had tried to bake some celebratory <em>maduros</em> in
the oven, but they just ended up getting burnt. Mamá didn’t care about
the mess, though, and she helped Luz make another batch with some expert
guidance this time around. They turned out perfect.</p>
<p>“Sorry about the picture, Luz,” Willow said from behind her.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” was all the basilisk could respond with. She moved to wipe
away a tear that was threatening to roll down her cheek. As she did so,
she realized that she still had claw hands. She quickly and discreetly
morphed her hands back into their human shape. For some reason, the
morph actually hurt, which was weird. Eh, it was probably just some
side-effect of the moon beam. She clenched an relaxed her fists. That
was better. Now she could wipe the tear away.</p>
<p>“So I’m guessing no moonlight conjuring?” Gus asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I think we should call it off. Even that little sliver of
moonlight hurt like a mother trucker,” Luz said, forcing a laugh.</p>
<p>“Although, while you’re here, how about I give you guys a tour of the
Owl House? As long as we block out all the windows, that is,” she
continued.</p>
<p>“That’s not a bad idea,” Willow said.</p>
<p>“Sure!” Gus replied enthusiastically, hoping that meant he could
touch more things from the Human Realm.</p>
<p>“Alrighty then. In that case: Hello, my name is Luz Noceda, and I’ll
be your tour guide this evening,” Luz said, acting like one of those
college recruiters she had seen when she, Mamí, and Papa had visited the
UConn campus.</p>
<p>Luz cautiously peeked out the doorframe, checking to see if their
were any stray pain beams streaming in through the window, of which
there were none. Letting out a breath she didn’t know she was holding,
Luz motioned for the others to follow behind.</p>
<p>“This house was constructed by the… wait. Hold on. HOOTY!” Luz
shouted, dropping the act. She had no clue who actually built the house.
She doubted that it was Eda’s doing. The house seemed too ancient.</p>
<p>Hearing his name called, the house demon snaked his way up the
stairs.</p>
<p>“Who dares awaken me from my slumber? Oh, hi Luz.”</p>
<p>“Quick question, Hooty: Who built the Owl House?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“My mom!” Hooty replied cheerfully.</p>
<p>“You have a mom?” Luz knew that had to be a lie.</p>
<p>“Uh huh! Momma told me that when a Mother House Demon and a Father
House Demon want to have a kid, they contract a stork to deliver all the
supplies, and then the parents spend years constructing the house, and
then they spend a night together having fun and the next day the baby
house demon shows up inside the door to the house. Except, Momma told me
that Papa had to go buy some milk and then he disappeared forever, so
she had to build me all alone. I’m a big boy house, though, so I have
definitely never cried about the fact.”</p>
<p>“That can’t be real. That has to be made up, right?” Luz turned to
her friends to see if they believed the clearly deranged bird worm. Both
Willow and Gus silently shook their heads and mouthed the word “No.”</p>
<p>“Alright, well, thank you, Hooty. Oh, and can you, like, cover all
the windows please?” Luz asked, hoping that was in the realm of
possibility.</p>
<p>“Sure thing! Are we doing a summoning ritual?” The house demon
gasped. “I can go get some blood from the night market!”</p>
<p>“No, Hooty! We’re not doing that. It’s just that the moonlight is
hurting me for some reason.”</p>
<p>“Oh, okay!” The bird tube said. Suddenly, solid metal grates covered
all the windows, a kuh-CHUNK sound echoing through the house.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Hooty. Now, can you go outside and take a nap or something?”
Luz asked. She loved the house demon, truly, but he could get on your
nerves really quickly.</p>
<p>“You’ve got it, hoot hoot!” Hooty said before slithering back down
the stairs and closing the front door.</p>
<p>“Sorry about that,” Luz said as she entered the now safe hallway.
“Alright, back to the tour. So, uhm, that was Hooty. He pretty much
controls everything around here. The pipes, the ventialtion, the
lights.”</p>
<p>As if on cue, all the lights in the house blacked out, shrouding the
entire building in shadow.</p>
<p>“And when he falls asleep, everything shuts off.” Luz finished, just
now remembering that fact.</p>
<p>Then, Luz had an idea.</p>
<p>“Should I cast a light spell, or do you guys secretly have night
vision?” Luz asked. She hadn’t shown off the light glyph to her friends
yet!</p>
<p>“That would be nice, but don’t you not have a bile sac?” Willow
questioned.</p>
<p>“Who says I need one? Observe.” Luz then pulled out her pad of sticky
notes and carefully traced out the light glyph with her pencil. Tapping
the glyph, it crumpled up into a small ball of light, illuminating the
three friends.</p>
<p>“Woah, that’s awesome!” Gus said.</p>
<p>“Can you show me how you did that?” Willow asked.</p>
<p>“Sure. It’s really just drawing a few overlapping shapes, then
tapping it and presto, you’ve got a portable sun!” Luz drew out another
light glyph, this time showing Willow each step along the way.</p>
<p>“Wait, so if there’s a light one, is there a darkness one too?” Gus
questioned.</p>
<p>Luz thought about that for a second. If there were other glyphs out
there, would they follow some kind of theme? “I have no idea,” she
answered.</p>
<p>“Well, how about we look for some?” Willow suggested.</p>
<p>“Yeah, let’s do it!” Gus agreed.</p>
<p>Luz slumped down onto the couch and sighed. They had tried for the
past hour and a half to discover any other glyphs that could exist.
Well, they did that after waking Hooty up first. The Owl House had its
fair share of not exactly “child-safe” accoutrements, and walking into a
sword hanging on the wall was not on Luz or Gus’ bucket list. (The two
of them promised to make Willow a bucket list some day.)</p>
<p>Now it was searching time!</p>
<p>Since her first glyph had come from when her phone had been cracked
back when Eda’s curse had flared up, the group had reasoned that it was
probably due to the fact that Luz’s phone was somehow able to decipher
the glyphs inherent in spell circles.</p>
<p>So that’s what they tried. Luz would pull up her camera and start
recording, and either Willow or Gus would cast a small spell. Then, they
would go and check the footage. Their efforts didn’t bear any fruit,
though. Try as they might, all they could see were the spell circles and
the result of said spell. No triangles or inscribed circles or anything.
But they did get some cool shots of Gus doing some super realistic
illusions and Willow being an absolute powerhouse in regard to plant
magic, whatever that was worth. Which wasn’t really much for what they
were looking for.</p>
<p>Glumly, Willow joined Luz on the couch and spun up a small
stunflower. Picking it from the crack in the floorboards, Willow rolled
it around in her fingers, the flower eventually bumping into Luz’s
face.</p>
<p>“Nyeh, stop th-” Luz went to bat the flower out of her face when she
noticed something weird about it.</p>
<p>“Hold on. Can I see that, Willow?” Luz asked. She might have just
been seeing something that wasn’t there, but she was pretty sure she saw
a small marking in the center of the flower.</p>
<p>“Oh, sure.” Willow handed the flower over to Luz, who pulled out her
phone and once again opened up the camera.</p>
<p>Luz swiped over from Video to Picture mode and focused the lens
directly on the center of the flower. Then, she zoomed in.</p>
<p>“Oh my Titan, there’s a glyph in the flower!” Luz couldn’t stop
herself from shouting in her excitement.</p>
<p>“Really?!” Gus said, running in from the kitchen, a bucket full of
human items clutched in his hand.</p>
<p>“Yeah, look!” Luz handed the flower and phone over to the youngest
witch.</p>
<p>“Woah, that’s super cool.” Gus spun the flower like a top, looking at
the glyph from every possible angle.</p>
<p>Gus handed the phone and flower back to the basilisk. Luz quickly
took a photo of the glyph for safekeeping.</p>
<p>The basilisk then quickly went to work on tracing out the new glyph.
It looked somewhat like a flower, fittingly. Contained inside a circle,
much like the light glyph, this new one had a small circle with a dot in
the center at the bottom, with the upper portion being a wide V shape
that had a line with a triangle splitting it down the middle. The
triangle was then split up into an upper and lower portion, a horizontal
linerunning from side to side.</p>
<p>Luz copied the design down meticulously, making sure she got each
detail exactly right.</p>
<p>Now, for the moment of truth. Luz tapped the glyph with her
finger.</p>
<p>Instead of crumpling into a ball of light, the sticky note sprouted a
small vine, not unlike the ones that Willow had used to ensnare Luz when
the two had first met.</p>
<p>Luz jumped to her feet and did a fist pump. “Yes! Glyph number two,
let’s go! Heck yeah!”</p>
<p>If Luz had been paying attention, she would have noticed that she had
suddenly grown an extra appendage. Behind her, her tail wagged back and
forth like a dog who just got promised a treat.</p>
<p>Willow and Gus both looked towards each other after they noticed the
new addition to their friend’s backside. Willow gave a thumbs up and Gus
nodded.</p>
<p>“Hey, uh, Luz?” Gus said quietly.</p>
<p>“Yeah? What’s up Gustaban?” Luz asked, completely oblivious to her
new body part.</p>
<p>“Look behind you,” was all he answered with.</p>
<p>The girl did a complete 180, turning to face the wall, her tail
whipping around, causing Willow to duck out of the way. “What? Did you
see a spider or something?”</p>
<p>“No, I mean just turn your head around.”</p>
<p>“Oh that’s what you… meant.” Luz turned to stare at her tail. It
slowly stopped wagging.</p>
<p>“Well, this is embarassing.”</p>
<p>While her tail <em>SCHLORPED</em> its way back into nothingness, Luz
let out a wry chuckle. For some reason, the morphing still caused a
small smidge of pain. Dang moonlight weirdness.</p>
<p>“Heh, sorry about that.”</p>
<h1 id="luz-meets-twin-one-and-twin-two">Luz Meets Twin One and Twin
Two</h1>
<p><strong>Schlaftag 1, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>“Breakfast is ready! Come get something before I give it all to
Hooty!” Eda yelled from the kitchen, the smell of sizzling… something
wafting up the stairs and into Luz’s room.</p>
<p>Luz shuffled her way out of her sleeping bag and loosed a massive
yawn. She was <em>not</em> a morning person. She quickly shifted herself
into some sweatpants and one of her favorite <em>Good Witch Azura</em>
t-shirts. A nice, comfy outfit.</p>
<p>Uh oh, bad decision, Luz! She had forgotten about the whole moonlight
fiasco from last night. As her pajamas were replaced with her chosen
attire, Luz doubled over in pain, clutching at her stomach. She felt
like she had just taken a left hook directly to the kidney.</p>
<p>“Sweet mother of Titan, that hurt,” Luz said through gritted teeth.
She took in a sharp breath and blinked a few times. Composing herself,
the basilisk slowly walked down the stairs, rubbing at her side to try
and alleviate the pain.</p>
<p>“You alright, kid? You aren’t lookin’ too hot,” Eda said as Luz
entered the room. The Owl Lady was busy frying up some bacon, but
stopped once she saw the state her apprentice was in.</p>
<p>“I’ve been better. Do you have any, like, magical painkillers?” Luz
replied, taking a seat at the table.</p>
<p>“Is this about that moon thing that happened last night?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Whenever I try to shapeshift it hurts.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ve got a potion or two somewhere that can fix that.
Shouldn’t take it on an empty stomach, though, so get some food in you
first,” Eda instructed while scouring through the cabinets.</p>
<p>Not wanting to know what horrible thing would probably happen to her
if she took the painkiller on an empty stomach, Luz grabbed a
freshly-washed apple and bit into it. As she chewed, she pondered over
how weird it was that so many things from the Human Realm had a
one-to-one analogue here in the Demon Realm. Given, eating apples from
the Human Realm that had spoiled didn’t get you intoxicated and stuck on
the roof. Luz had discovered that nifty fact when she had found Eda atop
the Owl House, surrounded by a bevy of rotten apple cores. That night
had been a struggle.</p>
<p>“Found it!” Eda called out, holding up a glowing blue potion. The
witch handed the medicine over to her ailing housemate. “Here ya go,
kiddo.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Eda. How long should this last?” Luz asked, weighing the
bottle in her hand.</p>
<p>The Owl Lady did some quick mental math. “I’d say it should hold for
about 12 hours, give or take.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Down the hatch!” Luz proclaimed before chugging the potion.
It tasted oddly sweet, like someone had mixed an energy drink and a
cappuccino together. The potion kicked in almost immediately, and Luz
let out a sigh of relief as she felt the pain subside.</p>
<p>To further test if the potion was working, Luz morphed into her
basilisk form, waited a few seconds to see if it hurt, and and then back
to human., all with no pain whatsoever!</p>
<p>“Now that that’s settled, you want some breakfast kid?” Eda
asked.</p>
<p>“Yes please, I am starving.” Luz responded, her stomach grumbling,
clearly not satisfied with just an apple.</p>
<p>“Then feel free to help yourself to some-”</p>
<p>“HOOT HOOT SPEEDY DELIVERY!” Hooty burst his head through the window,
sending shards of glass flying into the meal that Eda had just laid
down. The house demon then lightly placed down a basket covered in a
blanket.</p>
<p>“Hooty! Why did you just-” Luz let out a groan, not even bothering to
finish the sentence.</p>
<p>“Is it some kind of gift basket?” Luz asked, examining the
package.</p>
<p>“It’s probably someone trying to sacrifice their firstborn to me,
even though I keep telling people to stop doing that,” Eda supplied.</p>
<p>Eda slowly pulled back the blanket, revealing a snoring bat creature.
“And I was right. Dang it.”</p>
<p>Luz noticed a small slip of paper stuck to the underside of the
blanket. She removed it and began reading. “<em>Owl Lady, I am to go
away from home for the night. I entrust you to keep child
safe</em>.”</p>
<p>Eda flapped her hand dismissively, cutting Luz off. “Psh. Like
that’ll ever happen.”</p>
<p>“<em>If child stay safe, you shall be handsomely rewarded.</em> And
then it’s signed by someone named Yi Yi<em>.</em>”</p>
<p>Eda ripped the paper out of Luz’s hand, reading it herself to make
sure she didn’t just imagine what Luz had just said.</p>
<p>“Luz, do you know who Yi Yi is?” Eda asked.</p>
<p>“Not necessarily. Should I?” Luz responded.</p>
<p>“Should you? <em>Should you?!</em> Yi Yi is only the wealthiest demon
on all of the Boiling Isles. If you get in her good graces, you’ll be
swimming in snails for the rest of your life!” Eda would’ve been
dumbfounded that someone didn’t know of the legendary Bat Queen, but
then again Luz had only been on the Isles for a little under a
month.</p>
<p>“So all we’ve gotta do is keep a baby alive for a few hours and then
we can practice diving into our pools of snails. How hard could that
be?” Eda said.</p>
<p>“This’ll be so fun!” Luz exclaimed. “What games should we play to
keep the little sweetie occupied?”</p>
<p>“’We’? There is no ‘we’ here,” Eda said pointedly.</p>
<p>“What? Why?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Because I have lots of overdue books that need to be returned to the
BPL.” To emphasize her point, Eda cast a spell circle, causing a giant
stack of books to fall in front of Luz, who quickly caught them before
they could tumble to the ground.</p>
<p>“Aww, but the baby is so cute!” Luz argued.</p>
<p>As if to spite Luz, the baby decided to wake up. Having no idea where
it was, it became agitated and flew up to the ceiling, breathing fire to
try and scare away the strangers.</p>
<p>“Never mind. I’ve got to go. Have fun babysitting, Eda!” Luz said,
slamming the door shut and running off with the pile of books.</p>
<p>As Luz entered the main foyer of the BPL, she regretted not getting a
wagon or something to carry all the books in. They were <em>heavy</em>.
Like her prayer had been answered, the books suddenly began levitating,
flying off to the main desk, which was still being run by the same witch
from before.</p>
<p>One by one, each book flew through a spell circle, and one by one
each was marked as <em>LATE</em>. The librarian then took particular
offense to a grimoire that Luz had seen Eda reading late at night a few
days prior. They opened the book and grimaced at the quality it was
in.</p>
<p>“Apple blood, dirt, <em>and</em> potion residue. These were Eda’s
weren’t they?”</p>
<p>“Hehe,” Luz nervously chuckled. “Got it in one.”</p>
<p>The librarian sighed. “I’ll just put these on her tab. Which she
still hasn’t paid in over 13 years. Oh, and we’ll be closing early for
tonight’s Wailing Star meteor shower.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, what’s that?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Something that a young witch like you shouldn’t mess with,” the
librarian responded flatly.</p>
<p>“Well that just makes me want to know even more!” Luz exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Fine, go. I’m not paid enough to care, anyways,” the librarian
replied.</p>
<p>Luz made her way over to the Demon Decimal System. “Do any of you
know where I can find a book about the Wailing Star?” she asked. One of
the heads lolled out its tongue, and Luz grabbed the strip of paper.
<em>523: Celestial bodies and phenomena</em> was her destination. With a
quick thank you, Luz set off, steadfast on her quest.</p>
<p>Until she got distracted by a certain emerald-haired witch who was
currently reading to kids.</p>
<p>“’And so the Opossum used the thorn to stab at the Wolf’s paw.
Believing the Opossum to be the Snake, the Wolf ran off, leaving the
Opossum in its hole.’” Amity finished reading and closed the book to a
round of applause from the gathered witches and demons.</p>
<p>After the crowd had dispersed, Amity walked over to greet Luz.</p>
<p>“Hey, Luz!”</p>
<p>“Hi, Amity.”</p>
<p>“So, uhm, about the… thing… that happened at the Covention. I’m sorry
for snapping at you,” Amity apologized nervously.</p>
<p>“No problem,” Luz replied, brushing it off. “It’s all water under the
bridge.”</p>
<p>“I have no idea what that means,” Amity said candidly, confused at
the odd turn of phrase.</p>
<p>“Oh right, human expression. What that basically means is that what
happened in the past can’t be changed, so should just accept that it
happened and go on with our life.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. The Human Realm has a lot of weird phrases,” Amity posited.</p>
<p>“Oh you have no idea,” Luz said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Hey, Mittens!” A voice called out. Amity’s face instantly grew a
shade of bright red.</p>
<p>Luz and Amity both turned to see who had called out to them. Just
outside the entrance to the Kid’s Section, two witches, both looking to
be about 16 years old, stood waiting. The two appeared to both be
members of the Illusion track at Hexside, donning the powder blue
variation of the school uniform. The girl on the left had her long,
forest green hair braided, trailing down her back. Alongside her
uniform, she also wore a white pearl necklace and had on a pair of small
gold earrings. Her face was blemish free, save for a small beauty mark
under her left eye. The boy, who stood to the right, also had the same
color of hair, though his was short and messy. He had a mirrored version
of the girl’s beauty mark, with his being under his right eye. His
attire seemed to be more simplistic, lacking the accessories that the
girl had on.</p>
<p>“Ugh, what do you two want?” Amity questioned the new-comers.</p>
<p>“Mom says that you forgot your lunch. Again.” The boy then held up a
bright pink lunch-bag with a rabbit face sewn onto it. He then walked
over, the girl trailing behind him, and tossed the bag at Amity, who
begrudgingly caught it.</p>
<p>“Do you know these people, Amity?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I do,” Amity responded. “Luz, these are Edric and
Emira, my older siblings and perpetual thorns in my side.”</p>
<p>“So you’re the witch who bested our baby sister in the duel at the
Covention? Mittens would not stop talking about you,” Emira said.</p>
<p>“Stop calling me that!” Amity yelled.</p>
<p>“Which one? Mittens or baby sister?” Edric chimed in.</p>
<p>“Both, thank you,” Amity said, clearly annoyed.</p>
<p>“Hmm. Nah. Teasing you is too much fun.” Edric said after tapping his
chin, miming being deep in thought.</p>
<p>“You two can leave any second now.”</p>
<p>Emira gasped. “Are you implying you don’t like our company? Oh how
you wound us so, Mittens!”</p>
<p>“Leave. Now,” Amity growled.</p>
<p>“Fine, Mittens. We’ll go,” Edric said, dragging out the goodbye.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Amity replied with a huff.</p>
<p>The twins then jauntily walked away, leaving Luz and Amity alone in
the Kid’s Corner.</p>
<p>“I’m guessing those were the twins you told me about?” Luz
replied.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Sorry you had to meet them like that. Ed and Em can be
<em>really</em> annoying when they try,” Amity apologized.</p>
<p>“So typical sibling behavior?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Pretty much. How about you? Do you have any siblings back in the
Human Realm?”</p>
<p>“Nope. It’s just me and my mom. I’ve always wanted to have a younger
sibling, though.” Luz said with a small frown.</p>
<p>“Well if that ever happens, promise not to turn into Ed or Em,
alright?” Amity asked.</p>
<p>Luz laughed. “Yeah, I’ll keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t mind me asking, why did you come here? I doubt it was
to see me,” Amity said.</p>
<p>“Well, originally I was just here to return some overdue books for
Eda, but then the librarian said that they were closing down early
tonight for this thing called the Wailing Star. Obviously, me being me,
I wanted to see what that was but then I got distracted by you reading
to kids and I just realized that sounds kinda weird. Sorry, I’ll shut
up,” Luz said quickly, silently cursing her tendency to motormouth.</p>
<p>That earned a chuckle from Amity. “No, no. That’s fine. You said you
wanted to know more about the Wailing Star?”</p>
<p>“Uh huh.” Luz replied with a nod.</p>
<p>“I’m no expert on celestial happenings, but I’m pretty sure that the
Wailing Star is supposed to cast some sort of spell on the books in this
library. It apparently has something to do with the stained glass window
over the front entrance and the way the light from the meteor shines
through it, but that’s about all I know.” Amity had been given a brief
rundown by Malphas about the Wailing Star before, but she was only half
paying attention when he began talking about the intricacies of the
event.</p>
<p>“Woah, that sounds awesome! Why would they close down the library
when super cool magic stuff happens?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not really sure, but I guess they could be concerned about
safety or something,” Amity replied with a shrug.</p>
<p>“Well, if it was up to me, I would be throwing an epic party whenever
the Wailing Star was nearby,” Luz said.</p>
<p>“And what would be at the party?” Amity inquired.</p>
<p>“I dunno, Wailing Star cupcakes and a piñata?” Luz supplied.</p>
<p>“Do you mean a pain-yata?” Amity was confused by the basilisk’s
pronunciation.</p>
<p>“No, I mean a… oh this is another one of those weird Boiling Isles
analogues. Sure, a pain-yata,” Luz said after realizing what Amity
meant.</p>
<p>“Well, I would definitely go to that party, then.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be sure to invite you.”</p>
<h1 id="luz-embraces-her-inner-horse-girl">Luz Embraces Her Inner Horse
Girl</h1>
<p><strong>Schlaftag 1, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Luz opened the door to the Owl House, revealing Eda and King on the
couch. The two of them were both wearing ear protection, with Eda having
removed her hands and stuck them in her ears, while King had pillows
strapped to his skull. In Eda’s arms, she softly cradled the bat baby
creature thing as best she could without hands, gently rocking it back
and forth. King, meanwhile, was curled up and relaxing comfortably on
the arm of the couch, using the pillows both as ear muffs and actual
pillows.</p>
<p>“Hey, guys.” Luz said, making her presence known. “Got your books
returned, Eda.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for doing that, kid. We’ve still got our hands full, as you
can see,” Eda said, still rocking the baby.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll have you know that you look very motherly,” Luz
replied.</p>
<p>“Call me that word again and I take away your bed.” Eda glared at the
basilisk to drive home the threat.</p>
<p>“What? How could you say that around this little cutie patootie?” Luz
walked over and gave the baby a scratch on the tummy.</p>
<p>“No, don’t do that!” Eda warned, but it was too late. As if
reflexively, the baby awoke from its nap and proceeded to vomit out a
duplicate of itself, and the duplicate in turn barfed out another clone.
Now with three baby bat demons, the triplets began crying after being
rudely awoken and/or brought into existence, their wails assaulting
Luz’s eardrums.</p>
<p>“I knew babies could be loud, but this seems like a bit much,” Luz
said, covering her ears with her hands.</p>
<p>The babies flew all around the living room, trashing everything that
wasn’t nailed down to the floor. Potions were thrown willy-nilly, and
Luz was pretty sure that one of them was now wearing a pair of Eda’s
boots.</p>
<p>Wait, Luz could shapsehift. That means she didn’t have to have
ears!</p>
<p>While it was a little weird feeling her ears disappear (and a little
bit painful), the incessant crying from the babies did eventually give
way to a peaceful silence. Except now she couldn’t hear anything,
including Eda trying to talk to hear. She could see the Owl Lady’s lips
moving, but she had no idea what the witch was saying.</p>
<p>“I can’t hear you,” Luz said, pointing to where her right ear used to
be. She hoped she said it loud enough for the others to hear, but it
could have been as quiet as a whisper for all she knew.</p>
<p>Eda got the message, though. She thought for a moment before pointing
to the kitchen. She then mimed biting into something spherical, and then
mimed cutting something.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to get an apple and a knife?” Luz asked. Eda nodded
in confirmation.</p>
<p>Running into the kitchen, Luz quickly grabbed an apple from the fruit
bowl on the counter, a large knife from the collection on the wall, and
a cutting board from below the stove top.</p>
<p>Luz returned to the living room and handed the items to Eda, who
promptly propped her ankle up on her her knee and laid the cutting board
down on the makeshift table. Popping her hands back into place, Eda
placed the apple on the cutting board and steadied it. Once everything
was settled, Eda began to cut the apple into thin slices.</p>
<p>The second the knife made contact with the apple, the babies
immediately stopped causing a ruckus, flying down from the ceiling to
sit in a row in front of Eda, patiently waiting for their treat.</p>
<p>Now that the coast was clear, Luz morphed her ears back into
existence. The sounds of the world rushed back to her. The slight
creaking of the floorboards. The occasional breathing within the walls
that Luz still didn’t know the cause of. The random screaming outside.
It all returned. As Luz got her bearings, she heard Eda say something,
but she wasn’t sure what.</p>
<p>“Sorry, could you repeat that?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘Thanks,’” Eda replied.</p>
<p>As Eda was giving Baby #2 its third slice, her scroll buzzed.
Retrieving it from her pocket, Eda looked at the notification before
handing it to Luz.</p>
<p><strong>Conversation with: WitchChick128</strong></p>
<p>WitchChick128: Hello, Ms. Clawthorne. I need to talk with Luz, and
since she doesn't have a scroll, I figured you would be the second best
option. Could you let me talk to her?<br />
BADGIRLCOVEN: yo this is Luz<br />
BADGIRLCOVEN: whats up<br />
WitchChick128: Ed and Em just snuck out of the manor, and they were
talking about the Wailing Star.<br />
WitchChick128: I'm pretty sure they headed in the direction of the
library.<br />
BADGIRLCOVEN: and you need me for what? backup in case things go
south?<br />
WitchChick128: Yes. Can you get to the library quickly?<br />
BADGIRLCOVEN: yeah, especially if I morph something fast<br />
WitchChick128: Great! Thank you, Luz.<br />
BADGIRLCOVEN: no prob :)</p>
<p>Handing Eda her scroll back, Luz explained the situation. “I’ve got
to head to the library. Amity needs backup for fending off Ed and Em’s
pranks. Or something like that. Anyways, I gotta go. Byeee!”</p>
<p>With that parting, Luz ran out the front door of the Owl House. She
needed something fast, and nothing was more apt for this situation than
a horse. While cheetahs were faster, they could only keep that speed up
for a short distance, and the library was a few miles away, so she
needed consistent high speed, and that was what the horse offered.</p>
<p>As Luz pictured the morph, she felt a stabbing pain as her fingers
and toes melded together to become hooves of thick keratin. Pushing
through the pain, her a wave of brown fur began spreading across her
body, emanating from her wrists before going down to her ankles. Sensing
that she was about to fall forward, Luz got on all fours before she was
forced to by gravity. As the morph continued, she felt her nose elongate
and shift into a snout, jutting out in front of her. Her mouth had been
dragged along for the ride, as well. However, her eyes decided to shift
towards the side of her head,making it harder to concentrate on her
giant snout. Finally, a tail sprouted behind her, topped off with a
thick tuft of fur.</p>
<p>With the morph complete, Luz cautiously took her first few steps in
her new body. She quickly developed a strategy. Left hind leg forward.
Then right hind leg. Then left foreleg. Then right foreleg. Repeat until
you get to where you need to go.</p>
<p>As she got more used to the odd movements, Luz gradually picked up
speed until she was going at full blast. The wind that she could barely
feel before now flowed through her mane, whipping it around behind her
like she was in one of those commercials for a super expensive
perfume.</p>
<p>As her hooves pounded against the cobblestone, Luz weaved around the
witches and demons walking the streets. She passed by shopkeepers of the
Night Market, citizens out for walks, and she was pretty sure she
galloped past a group of kids who were undoubtedly breaking curfew. As
she ran by, most stopped to turn and stare at her. To them, some foreign
beast had just emerged from nowhere and was streaking down the main road
at an incredibly fast speed.</p>
<p>In what felt like no time at all, Luz stood before the entrance to
the library. Amity was waiting at the top of the steps, looking around
for her backup.</p>
<p>Sensing an opportunity, Luz trotted over to the young Blight and
neighed to get the witch’s attention.</p>
<p>“Hey, Luz,” Amity said, before pausing. “Wait, you are Luz, right?
I’m not just talking to some random creature?”</p>
<p>Luz let out an offended snort. Who else could rock a mane like this?
She tossed her head back, letting it fall gracefully onto her back.</p>
<p>She quickly morphed back into her Luz-but-with-Witch-ears form, once
again noticing the sharp pain that accompanied it. The potion from
earlier must have worn off, she surmised.</p>
<p>“Really, Amity? Do you think anyone else could look so stylish while
being a horse? I’m appalled, honestly,” Luz said sarcastically.</p>
<p>Amity chuckled. “No, I guess not.”</p>
<p>“Alright, then what’s the plan?” Luz said, puttting on a serious
face.</p>
<p>“Oh… um…” Amity stalled and grew flustered, not ready for the
question. “I guess go in there and fix whatever Ed and Em have
broken.”</p>
<p>Luz smiled at the girl. “Good plan! Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Without waiting, Luz loosed a battle cry and charged at the door,
throwing a leaping kick at it. The door offered no resistance
whatsoever, and Luz practically sailed into the library before crashing
down onto the floor, letting out an <em>OOF</em> as the wind was knocked
out of her. That drew a loud laugh from Amity, who cautiously stepped
through the now open door and offered the embarrassed Luz a hand up,
which was accepted.</p>
<p>Making their way through the main foyer, which seemed relatively
unchanged, the two entered the main hall of the library, which looked…
different, to say the least.</p>
<p>“Yup, Ed and Em have been through here,” Amity concluded.</p>
<p>To their left, a veritable mountain of snow covered numerous
bookshelves, complete with a few small snowmen placed at the base. On
the right, a mix of froufrou dresses and tuxedos and Dragon Claw Z-esque
jumpsuits were strewn about on the floor. Above them, birds that Luz
thought to be extinct circled her head, occasionally screeching.</p>
<p>There was one constant amongst all this chaos, though: books.
Wherever there was something weird, an open book would be nearby.</p>
<p>“Hmm… I wonder…” Luz thought aloud. She walked over to one of the
books that was close to an expensive-looking dress. She closed the book,
and the dressed poofed out of existence, as if it was never there in the
first place. Walking over to another book, she closed it, leading to the
Dragon Claw Z getup vanishing in a similar manner to the dress.</p>
<p>On the other side of the library, Amity had made the same discovery,
with the mountains of snow disappearing before Luz’s eyes as Amity
closed both <em>Snowballs, a History</em> and <em>Winter for
Dummies</em>.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of distressed quacking pierced through the
relative silence, which was soon followed by a pair laughing. Luz and
Amity sprinted towards the source of the troubled duck, only to find
that the twins were long gone by the time they arrived. The only
evidence was <em>Quacks Wants Snacks</em> laying atop a bookshelf.</p>
<p>Amity opened the book, and Quacks appeared, though the duck had a
horrifyingly human pair of legs. Quacks began screaming again, so Luz
tried to calm it down by softly stroking its fur. As Amity investigated
the book, she saw that Quacks normal legs had been drawn over with a
pencil, leading to its odd appearance. Amity quickly closed the book to
stop Quacks’ suffering.</p>
<p>“The poor little guy had no idea what was going on,” Luz
lamented.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to make Ed and Em come to their senses before they get
themselves hurt,” Amity said.</p>
<p>“At least they weren’t being sneaky,” Luz replied, pointing towards
the books that had been scattered on the floor, creating a trail the two
could follow.</p>
<p>After following the path of books (and puttting them back in their
rightful spot), Luz and Amity had reached an apparent dead end at the
Romance section. Luz looked around to see if there were any other books
that could indicate where the twins had gone, but her searching was
fruitless.</p>
<p>After watching the other girl putter about, Amity let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“I think I know where they are,” she said quietly. She then reached
up and pulled down <em>The Lone Witch and the Secret Room</em>. A
bookshelf in front of Luz slowly moved to the side revealing Amity’s
hidden study, and inside that study stood Edric and Emira Blight.</p>
<p>The twins were busy looking through all the books in their sister’s
private room, with a large pile gathered on the desk.</p>
<p>“Hey Mittens, glad you could join us,” Edric said, as if this was
nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>“What are you – Why – How did you even get in here?” Amity forced
out.</p>
<p>“We’re searching for your diary so we can post the pages all over
Penstagram. Why? Payback for you tattling about us cutting class. How?
We pulled the book down, just like you did. You should also probably
chose a more inconspicuous book, by the way. That one’s too easy to
figure out,” Emira calmly explained as she dumped another book on the
pile.</p>
<p>“Get. Out,” Amity growled.</p>
<p>“What? But we haven’t even found your diary yet!” Ed complained.</p>
<p>“I said GET OUT!” his younger sister yelled, pointing towards the
door.</p>
<p>“Ugh. Have it your way, Mittens. We’ll get out of your hair,” Em
said, throwing one last book onto the pile before leaving.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we were just having fun. Way to kill the vibe, Mittens,” Ed
added as he joined his twin.</p>
<p>The twins forced there way past Amity and began walking away. Amity
immediately began putting the books back in their shelves, but Luz
trailed after the twins.</p>
<p>“Hey!” she shouted.</p>
<p>Ed groaned and turned to face her, with Emira following suit. “Ugh,
what do you want?”</p>
<p>“Don’t think I didn’t see how you guys treated Amity back there.
That’s not how a family is supposed to act,” Luz said.</p>
<p>“Really, because that’s just how us Blights show tough love,” Em
responded.</p>
<p>“’Tough love’? That’s bat guano and you know it. Family members are
supposed to love and care for each other, not leak a person’s private
journal for everyone to see.”</p>
<p>“Look, kid. As Blights, we have a reputation to uphold. If we don’t,
then Mom gets royally pissy, and you don’t like her when she’s pissy.
That’s why we had to get back at Amity. She was making us, and by
extension our whole family, look bad. Now we can’t let that happen, can
we?” Ed explained.</p>
<p>“I’m just saying, have you guys considered standing up to your mom?”
Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Oh we’ve tried plenty of times, but nothing gets through to her,” Em
said.</p>
<p>“Well, can you at least be nicer to Amity?” Luz tried again.</p>
<p>The twins paused. “We’ll think on that,” they said in unison. With
that, the two left the library having made it to the foyer.</p>
<p>Luz quickly made her way back to Amity’s secret hideout. The
emerald-haired witch had already gotten a majority of the books back in
place, so Luz took the time to check out the witch’s personal
collection.</p>
<p>A strikingly familiar book spine caught her attention.</p>
<p>“No way! You have the Good Witch Azura books!?” Luz didn’t even know
that they existed in this realm. Well, except for the copies she had
brought over, but still!</p>
<p>“Oh, you’ve heard of them?” Amity asked, surprised by the other
girl’s excitement.</p>
<p>“Have I heard of them? I only have every book in the series, 1-5 in
both regular and Collector’s Edition versions,” Luz bragged.</p>
<p>“Wait, there’s a fifth one? I didn’t know that.” Amity guessed that
the she bought her collection from store (which had just gotten a new
manager, for some reason) hadn’t picked up the rights to sell the book
yet, but Luz had a copy somehow.</p>
<p>“Do you wanna have mine?” Luz said, rifling around in her backpack.
After a few seconds of searching, she pulled out <em>The</em> <em>Good
Witch Azura: Fall of Zargothrax</em> and offered it out to Amity.</p>
<p>Amity took the book and examined the front and back cover. Something
looked just a little bit off, but she couldn’t quite place her finger on
what exactly.</p>
<p>“Thank you. So when will you want this back?” she asked.</p>
<p>“You can keep it. I can’t let you have an incomplete set of the
greatest fiction series ever written,” Luz answered.</p>
<p>“Oh. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“No problem. I hope you like it as much as I did.”</p>
<p>As Luz walked back from the library, she took a deep breath, enjoying
the crisp chill air. Today had been a good day. She still needed to
retake that potion from before. Being able to shapeshift without feeling
ike she had just been stabbed was nice. She looked up at the moon. To
think that a rock floating in space could have such a lasting impact was
incredible, but also incredibly annoying.</p>
<p>Now that she thought about it, she had done some pretty big morphs
today, and she was feeling pretty hungry. It wasn’t a hunger for food,
though. Luz ignored the hunger and kept walking.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to cross the property line of The Owl House,
Luz collapsed.</p>
<h1 id="luz-finds-out-she-isnt-alone">Luz Finds Out She Isn’t Alone</h1>
<p><strong>Schlaftag 1, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Hooty was a good house demon, and as a good house demon, he was
responsible with making sure that everyone who lived in his walls was
kept safe, which also meant he had to know how everyone was doing at all
times. So when he felt someone suddenly fall to the ground, he knew
something was amiss.</p>
<p>Rocketing over to Luz’s unconscious body, he wrapped the basilisk up
and shot back to the house. He carefully maneuvered her body through the
front door before depositing her on the couch, laying her down gently to
make sure he didn’t startle her awake.</p>
<p>Eda and King walked in from the kitchen, where they had just put the
bat babies down for a nap.</p>
<p>“Hooty, what are you – Wait, Luz?!” Eda was confused by the bird
worm’s actions before she realized who he had just brought in. Eda was
now very glad that the babies were asleep.</p>
<p>“What happened?” King asked.</p>
<p>“She was walking over here, but then her body said it wanted to take
a nap!” Hooty replied cheerfully.</p>
<p>Eda groaned before dragging her hand down her face.</p>
<p>“Hooty, do me a favor and leave,” she said.</p>
<p>“Okay!” the house demon said, complying to the order and shutting the
front door.</p>
<p>Eda then knelt down in front of Luz’s unconscious body and waved a
hand in front of the girl’s face.</p>
<p>No reaction.</p>
<p>Eda snapped her fingers a few time.</p>
<p>Still nothing.</p>
<p>“Hello, Isles to Luz. Anybody in there?”</p>
<p>No luck.</p>
<p>King poked her side with one of his claws.</p>
<p>Eda gently shook Luz’s shoulders. “Come on, kid. Wake up.
Please.”</p>
<p>The witch shook harder. “Dang it, Luz. What’s gotten into you?”</p>
<p>Luz showed no signs of feeling any of what just happened.</p>
<p>Owlbert emerged from his witch’s hair. Her distress was obvious. He
hopped onto Eda’s shoulder before fluttering down to rest on Luz’s
chest. The palisman trilled softly and rubbed his head against Luz’s
neck. This finally drew a reaction from the basilisk, as she sniffed at
the air and then began drooling ever so slightly. She then moved to roll
over, except this action sent her careening off the edge of the
couch.</p>
<p>“Oh no you don’t!” Eda said, scooping up her apprentice before she
could face-plant on the hard wooden floor.</p>
<p>That is what finally got Luz to wake up.</p>
<p>“Huh? Wah? Wuzgoinon?” the girl slurred out, not quite sure what was
happening and how she had ended up back at the house.</p>
<p>Eda set Luz down on her feet before wrapping her up in a hug. “Oh
thank Titan, never do that to us again.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Eda was super scared! Not me, though. I knew you’d wake up,”
King boasted. Nonetheless, he joined the hug, wrapping his arms around
Luz’s legs.</p>
<p>“What, what happened? I remember walking back from the library and I
was feeling hungry, but not much after that,” Luz scratched at the back
of her neck. It felt itchy for some reason.</p>
<p>“Well, Hooty said that you were just about to make it here when you
collapsed. He wrapped you up and then dropped you off on the couch. We
tried to wake you up, but nothing worked, and then Owlbert nuzzled you
and ya nearly ate floor,” Eda explained.</p>
<p>Luz scratched at her arm. She also noticed that her vision was a
little blurry, which was odd.</p>
<p>“You sure your alright, kid?” Eda questioned, eying the girl
suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Yes, Eda, I’m fine. I’m just a little hungry, that’s all.” Luz used
her right foot to scratch her left calf.</p>
<p>“Really? Then when’s the last time you ate?” Eda crossed her
arms.</p>
<p>“Today at lunch. We had those tasty burgers, remember?” the basilisk
answered, rubbing her thumb across the back of her other hand.</p>
<p>“I know that kid, I was there. I’m talking about <em>magic</em>.
When’s the last time you had any magic?” Eda asked pointedly.</p>
<p>“Oh, that…” Luz realized. She thought about it for a moment before
responding, “I think the last time was when I drained Principal Bump.”
She said the last part slowly, still ashamed about the incident.</p>
<p>“And how long ago was that?” Eda raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“About three weeks ago?” Luz replied sheepishly.</p>
<p>“Kid?” Eda said.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Eda?” Luz knew where this was going.</p>
<p>“Are you telling me that you haven’t had any magic in <em>three
weeks</em>?” Eda couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Luz replied quietly, looking down at the floor.</p>
<p>Eda facepalmed, and then took a deep breath before slowly releasing
it. “Dang it, Luz. You are a basilisk, and basilisks eat magic. Did you
think you could just not eat magic and everything would be all
hunky-dory?”</p>
<p>“Kinda,” Luz said, still in a staring contest with a hole in the
floorboard.</p>
<p>Eda sighed. “Hey, kiddo, look up here.” Luz slowly raised her head to
make eye contact with the witch.</p>
<p>The Owl Lady grabbed her apprentice's shoulders. “As long as you’re
living under this roof, within these four walls, I’m gonna make sure
that you’re well fed, okay? No matter what you want or need, I’ll get it
for you, even if it’s the most illegal or dangerous thing ever. I’m not
having you starving when I can do anything about it,
<em>capisce</em>?”</p>
<p>Luz simply nodded, and Eda pulled the girl back into another hug.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry, kiddo,” Eda said.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Luz responded.</p>
<p>As the two disengaged the hug, Eda cleared her throat. “Alright,
mushy feelings time is over. Okay kid, open up.”</p>
<p>The Owl Lady spun up a spell circle, but stopped just before the
magic was cast.</p>
<p>“Wait, what? No way. I’m not going to drain you of your magic! That’s
insane!” Luz argued.</p>
<p>Eda cancelled the spell. “Look, kid. You need some magic in your
system real bad, and I’ve got plenty to offer.”</p>
<p>“But what if I go overboard? What if I can’t control myself?” Luz
replied.</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine. Besides, if you do try and take too much, King or
Hooty can just distract you so you stop,” Eda replied calmly.</p>
<p>“But-” Luz began.</p>
<p>“No buts,” Eda interrupted. “Now come on, I’m getting hungry as well,
and we could all use some dinner.” With that, Eda cast another spell
circle, forming a large ball of light that floated its way in front of
Luz.</p>
<p>“Fine,” Luz said begrudgingly. She opened her mouth and sucked in the
light, feeling her stomach fill up. Luz instantly felt way better than
before now that she actually had magic in her. As the basilisk drained
the ball of light, Eda showed no signs of even noticing that her magic
had been slightly depleted, standing with arms crossed and a smile on
her face.</p>
<p>“Feeling better now, kid?” Eda asked.</p>
<p>“Totally!” Luz replied cheerfully.</p>
<p>“Good, now let’s get some dinner,” Eda said, bending down to ruffle
Luz’s hair. As she did, though, she noticed that the girl’s eyes looked
weird, almost like they had been clouded over.</p>
<p>“Is your vision good, kid? Your eyes look a little… hazy,” Eda
noted.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” Luz said, brushing it off. “Probably just allergies or
something. No need to worry.”</p>
<p>“Alright, but if it sticks around, let me know, alright?” Eda
said.</p>
<p>“Got it.” Luz gave a thumbs up.</p>
<p>“Good. So what do you two want-” Eda began to say before she was cut
off by a knock at the door.</p>
<p>Luz went to open the door, careful to make sure she was in witch ear
mode. She grabbed the handle and pulled to reveal a ginormous pale face
filling her vision.</p>
<p>“Holy mother of-” Luz jumped backwards at the surprise. The giant
face forced itself through the doorway and into the living room. Before
Luz stood a giant head with bat wings and long black hair draped down
the back, though a rebellious forelock dangled in front.</p>
<p>Then Luz made the connection. “Woah, you must be Yi Yi.”</p>
<p>The giant head nodded. “Yes. Yi Yi is I, and I is the Bat Queen. You
have babies, yes?”</p>
<p>“Yup. They’re taking a nap right now,” Luz affirmed.</p>
<p>“Good, good.” Yi Yi said, before letting out a sharp whistle. From
the other room, the babies awoke, and they quickly flew back to their
mom. They all nuzzled against Yi Yi before disappearing into her
hair.</p>
<p>The Bat Queen vomited out a chest and spat out a whistle. “Reward,
for keep babies safe. Many thanks. Whistle is for troubles. You are all
owed one.” Eda opened the chest to see it replete with snails. Luz swore
she could see money signs in Eda’s eyes.</p>
<p>Yi Yi then turned to force her way through the door, but stopped and
sniffed the air. She turned to Luz and sniffed again. The Bat Queen put
her face right up against Luz and inhaled one more time to confirm her
suspicions.</p>
<p>“You not witch,” Yi Yi stated.</p>
<p>“What? That’s bologna! I’m totally a witch! Look, I’ve even got witch
ears! Tell her I’m a witch, Eda,” Luz tried to plead. It was at times
like this she wished she wasn’t a horrible liar.</p>
<p>“She’s not a witch, BQ,” Eda said, betraying Luz.</p>
<p>“I thought. You smell like basilisk. Unique smell,” Yi Yi said.</p>
<p>Something wasn’t adding up for Luz. “Wait, how do you know what
basilisk smells like?”</p>
<p>The Bat Queen laughed. “Live with me. Wash smell off very hard.”</p>
<p>Luz’s eyes widened as she realized what Yi Yi had just said. “Wait,
are you telling me that there are other basilisks, and they are
<em>living with you</em>?”</p>
<p>Yi Yi just nodded. “I protect all lost. They lost, I find, I keep
safe.”</p>
<p>Luz was floored. She had always had that inkling in the back of her
mind that hoped that she wasn’t the last of her kind, but to have it
<em>confirmed</em>. She was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>The Bat Queen noticed the girl’s silence. “You like meet them?” she
offered.</p>
<p>“Yes!” Luz answered, perhaps a bit too enthusiastically.</p>
<p>“Good. Tomorrow, come to den. You meet Tre, Ivy.” With that final
note, the Bat Queen squeezed through the front door and flew away from
the Owl House.</p>
<p>Luz ran out the door to thank Yi Yi, but by the time she was outside,
the Bat Queen had vanished into the night.</p>
<p>“Thank you!” Luz shouted to nobody.</p>
<p>She slowly went back inside, finding Eda and King back on the couch,
playing with all the snails that Yi Yi had rewarded them with.</p>
<p>“So, kid, you ready to dine like royalty?” Eda tossed a handful of
snails Luz’s way.</p>
<p>“Please,” Luz begged. “I am <em>starving</em>!”</p>
<p><strong>Gehetag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Luz slowly awoke to the sound of her alarm screaming. She fumbled
around for a few seconds before bopping it on the head to make it shut
up.</p>
<p>Today was the big day. She was finally going to meet other
basilisks!</p>
<p>Just as Luz was about to shift into her cat hoodie, she paused. If
she was going to be meeting other basilisks, it would probably be best
if she was in her basilisk form when she met them. She hadn’t been in
that form for a while, mainly sticking in either human mode or
witch-ears mode.</p>
<p>Luz pictured her basilisk form and quickly morphed. Now that she
actually had magic in her stomach, it didn’t hurt to shapeshift! Though,
she did feel a little bit weird for some reason. She couldn’t quite
describe it.</p>
<p>Back in her “natural” state, Luz slithered out her bedroom door and
across the hall to the bathroom. It was a tad bit harder to grab her
toothbrush, mainly on account of her suddenly having a different hand
structure. If she wanted to make a good first impression, though, then
having minty fresh breath was a good start.</p>
<p>Exiting the bathroom, Luz turned to head down to the kitchen when she
realized she had forgotten about something: stairs. In this form, she
had no idea how to get downstairs in a way that didn’t devolve into her
body-slamming each stair as she dropped down each one. After not being
able to come up with a way to go downstairs without hurting her stomach,
Luz resolved to just morph human, walk down the stairs like a normal
person, and then morph back into basilisk.</p>
<p>From the kitchen, Luz grabbed an apple to serve as an early-morning
snack. Slithering into the living room, she found King curled up on one
of the chests, soaking in the rays of the sun. Looking around, Eda was
nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Luz gently shook King awake. The bone creature yawned before looking
to see who disturbed his beauty sleep.</p>
<p>“Whadya want?” he said in between yawns.</p>
<p>“Do you know where Eda is?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>King let out another long yawn before responding, “Off in the forest.
Getting plants or something, I dunno. ‘m tired.” He moved to curl back
up, scooching to the right to follow the sun.</p>
<p>Eda kicked the front door open, a large burlap slack hanging over her
shoulder.</p>
<p>“Well, speak of the devil. Hi, Eda,” Luz greeted the witch with a
wave.</p>
<p>“Hey, kid. Have you had breakfast yet?” the Owl Lady inquired.</p>
<p>“Oh, uh, not really. Just an apple,” Luz supplied, holding up the
half-eaten fruit.</p>
<p>“Good. Try this.” Eda reached into the sack and withdrew a small
black object, which she then tossed to Luz.</p>
<p>Luz grabbed the projectile and examined it, turning it over in her
hand. “What exactly is this?” she asked.</p>
<p>“That, dear child, is a bloodberry. It’s a cousin to the goreberry,
and it’s reported to grow only where the Titan’s magic is particularly
strong,” Eda explained, before adding on, “Found that bad boy near a
weird lake. Go on, give it a taste!”</p>
<p>Luz cautiously bit into the berry, only to find a pleasant sweet
taste. She quickly swallowed it. “Woah, that was actually pretty
good!”</p>
<p>“Glad to hear it,” Eda said. “I’ve got a boatload of ‘em in here.
Well, that and some more normal fruits and veggies” She motioned with
the bag.</p>
<p>“Nice. Thanks, Eda!” Luz replied.</p>
<p>“Eh, don’t worry about it, kiddo. I said I’d keep you fed, and I
don’t intend to go back on my word.”</p>
<p>Eda collapsed into the couch, splaying her arms and legs out as she
got comfortable.</p>
<p>“So, kid, you ready to meet other basilisks?”</p>
<p>“Yup! I can’t wait!”</p>
<p>“That’s what I like to hear.”</p>
<h1 id="luz-journeys-into-bat-country">Luz Journeys Into Bat
Country</h1>
<p><strong>Gehetag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Outside The Den
of the Bat Queen</strong></p>
<p>Luz uncurled her tail from around Owlbert as she dismounted the
palisman before she set King down on the ground. Eda hopped off quickly
after. Owlbert crawled into his witch’s hair and disappeared into
whatever pocket dimension the Owl Lady’s hair held.</p>
<p>Before the trio stood what could only be described as a glitch in
reality. Even though there was a giant opening in the trees right in
front of her, Luz felt like her eyes were being forced to look off to
the right. If she focused hard, she could see the gap in the treeline,
but the second her focus was broken, the gap was filled as if it wasn’t
even there.</p>
<p>“This the spot?” Luz asked, doing her best to keep the gap
visible.</p>
<p>“Yup,” Eda confirmed, placing her hands on her hips. “BQ should be
here any second.”</p>
<p>“This feels so weird,” King commented, constantly whipping his head
around, making the gap appear and disappear before his eyes.</p>
<p>“That’s the point. It helps keep prying eyes away from her territory,
but if you know what you’re looking for it also helps you find it,” Eda
explained.</p>
<p>“So are we just gonna wait around –“ King started to say, but was cut
off by a shadow descending from the sky.</p>
<p>Yi Yi gracefully landed in front of the group, fluttering her wings
as she touched down.</p>
<p>“You here. Good. Tre, Ivy not know,” the Bat Queen said in her
everpresent thick accent.</p>
<p>“Wait, why didn’t you tell them?” Luz asked. If she was in Tre or
Ivy’s position, she would want to know everyone coming in and out of the
den.</p>
<p>“Ivy sad recently. Say she bored. You be fun surprise. Come, follow.”
Turning around, Yi Yi motioned with a wing for the others to follow
her.</p>
<p>Not wanting to let her chance to meet other basilisks slip through
her fingers (or, as she was now, claws), Luz quickly slithered after the
Bat Queen. Eda scooped King up in her arms and trailed behind the
basilisk. As they entered the forest, the trees towered over them, the
canopy blotting out nearly all light, casting the path into near total
darkness. Thinking on her feet (even though she didn’t have any), Luz
quickly cast a light glyph, holding the ball so she could see what was
just in front of her. Eda had a similar idea, casting her own light ball
and illuminating the surrounding area.</p>
<p>As they walked, Luz began to feel itchy again. Every so often she
would stop to scratch at whatever the offending body part was.
Unfortunately, her vision was starting to blur as well, and there wasn’t
anything she could do about that.</p>
<p>The group made their way further into the forest. Every so often,
they would see a stray palisman that the Bat Quuen had taken in. Each
time this would happen, Yi Yi would stop to briefly chat with the
creature, greeting them all by name. “Hello, Diane.” That was a little
pink… something. Luz couldn’t tell what exactly Diane was on account of
it bouncing around them so quickly, never giving her a clear view.
“Greetings, Tobias,” she said to a red-tailed hawk with a broken wing,
who chirped back cheerfully. “Morning, Jeremiah.” A bullfrog missing its
right fore leg ribbited in response.</p>
<p>As they all made their way closer to the den, the sunlight began
peeking through the canopy, gradually revealing more palismen as they
delved deeper into the forest, all of whom were living amongst the
trees. A snake with ginormous fangs, a three-headed monkey, a dragonfly,
and countless more roamed the vicinity. Luz couldn’t help but notice
that all of the palismen had oddly-shaped holes, as if they were meant
to be joined with something bigger.</p>
<p>“What’s with all the hole thingies in the palismen, Eda?” Luz asked,
turning to face the witch.</p>
<p>“Those are their interlocks,” the Owl Lady responded. “They exist so
that each palismen can only fit onto one staff.”</p>
<p>“So each of these precious little babies once belonged to someone?”
Luz reached out and pet a red cardinal who had been following after the
group. The bird leaned into Luz’s hand, basking in the attention it was
receiving. The cardinal chirped a few times before flying over to Eda,
who brushed it off with a hand.</p>
<p>“Yup, and since BQ took ‘em in, that means their witch either
abandoned them or went to meet the Titan.” Luz hoped most of them were
here because of the latter. She couldn’t believe that anyone would
willingly want to part ways with any of these angels.</p>
<p>The group continued to trek in relative silence for the next few
minutes before the Bat Queen suddenly stopped at the base of a hill and
held out her wing, motioning for the others to halt.</p>
<p>“Past hill my den,” she explained. She looked at Luz. “You ready meet
Tre, Ivy?”</p>
<p>“I’m as ready as I’ll ever be,” Luz replied, scratching behind her
ear.</p>
<p>“Good.” With that, Yi Yi turned and crested the hill, Luz following
right behind her.</p>
<p>In front of Luz stood an animal lover’s paradise. Hundreds, if not
thousands, of palismen, coming in all shapes and sizes, milled about.
The winged ones flitted to and fro, chirping and singing happily as they
conversed in their own language. The ones on the ground were similarly
exuberant, chasing each other in games of tag, hide and seek, or just
relaxing under a tree or by any of the numerous streams that cut through
the meadow. A dog-like creature sporting six legs and three tails broke
away from a game of tag it was playing and ran up to Yi Yi.</p>
<p>The Bat Queen squatted down and pet the creature with one of her
wings. “Hello, Chee. You get Tre, Ivy? Have surprise for them.”</p>
<p>The palisman nodded and let out a mix between a bark and a chirp
before running off back down the hill and disappearing in the mass of
palismen.</p>
<p>“Tre, Ivy here soon. Chee good tracker,” Yi Yi explained.</p>
<p>As the quartet waited for Chee to return with the Tre and Ivy,
numerous other palismen would come over to check out who the newcomers
were. A goose-like palisman with a bell piercing its beak was the first
to come invesitgate, though Eda eventually shooed it away once she
realized it was trying to steal her wallet. The next to visit was a
manticore, who flew over and began to buzz around King, trying to get
him to join in on some type of game, but King declined the offer. The
final palisman to visit was a white cat who had taken a liking to Luz,
brushing against her and batting at her tail. Luz had to admit the
feeling of the cat toying with her tail was a little funny. She began
playing with the cat by raising her tail and watching the cat jump up
and paw at it, only for Luz to move her tail just out of reach.
Eventually, Luz let the cat bat her tail one more time before scooping
it up and rubbing its stomach. After a few seconds, though, the cat
leapt out of Luz’s arms and returned to its friends.</p>
<p>“Hey, Yi Yi,” a new voice said. “Chee said you wanted to – Holy
Titan, Five is that you?!” Luz turned to see a pair of basilisks
following after Chee, who was practically sprinting up to the Bat Queen.
The basilisk on the left had light brown scales, not dissimilar to
Luz’s, with splotches of lighter-toned scales on their underbelly. Their
long ginger hair flowed down their back and was done up in a complicated
braid. The other basilisk had more of a red tone to their scales, but
also had a white underbelly, all of which was complimented nicely by
their mop of curly brown hair.</p>
<p>The light brown basilisk slithered up the hill at a speed that Luz
didn’t think was possible and wrapped her up in a tight hug. Luz was
caught off guard by the sudden embrace, but cautiously reciprocated the
gesture. The other basilisk’s tears leaked onto Luz’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“We – We thought you were dead!” they said through sobs.</p>
<p>Luz slowly pulled herself out of the hug. This would be a little hard
to explain. “I hate to burst your bubble, but I think you have me
confused for someone else. My name is Luz, not Five. I’ve never met
either of you. Sorry.”</p>
<p>The teary-eyed basilisk sniffled and wiped away more tears that were
forming. “What? But, but you look just like her.”</p>
<p>Luz nervously laughed and rubbed at her neck. “Well, I guess I’ve got
a doppelgänger I didn’t know about.” She then added on, “Can I, uh, get
your names? I know you two are Tre and Ivy, but I don’t know who’s
who.”</p>
<p>The basilisk with braided hair wiped at their eyes once again before
introducing themselves. “I’m Ivy. Sorry about what just happened. I got
so excited thinking that Five was back.”</p>
<p>“No, no, that’s fine,” Luz said. “If I was in your situation I would
probably react the same.”</p>
<p>The third basilisk finally spoke up. “Hi, I’m Tre,” he said with a
wave.</p>
<p>“I would say my name’s Luz,” the girl began, “but you guys already
know that. Anyways, these two are Eda, my mentor, and King, my
roommate.” Eda gave a two-finger salute to Tre and Ivy, while King just
picked at a flea that was annoying him, not even tuned into the
conversation.</p>
<p>Tre’s face lit up in recognition. “No way, you’re the Owl Lady!”</p>
<p>Eda chuckled and struck a pose for imaginary cameras. “I see that my
legend precedes me. Hope you’ve only heard good things.”</p>
<p>“Only the best!” Tre responded. “Especially the way you stick it to
Belos.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. You may not know it, but seeing your posters everywhere
reminds us that we can survive on the run, no matter the circumstance.”
Ivy chimed in, finally having recomposed herself.</p>
<p>“Well hot dang,” Eda said. “Didn’t know I meant that much to ya.”</p>
<p>“So how did you and Luz meet? She said she’s your apprentice or
whatever, so how did that happen?” Ivy asked, looking back and forth
between the two.</p>
<p>“Do you want to explain or should I?” Eda asked Luz.</p>
<p>“You go ahead. I would probably have a bajillion tangents if I
tried.” Luz scratched at her arm. She knew her own tendency to ramble,
and she didn’t want to make herself look like a fool in front of the
only two other basilisks on the Isles. Well, unless Five was out there
somewhere, whoever they were.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Eda began. “It all started ‘bout a month ago. I’d just
sent Owlbert out on a collection run when he came back early, and
chasing after him was a human, Luz.”</p>
<p>“Wait, why were you in the Human Realm?” Tre asked.</p>
<p>“That’s because I’m kinda sorta a human-basilisk hybrid?” Luz
nervously smiled and shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>“What.” Tre deadpanned.</p>
<p>“My working theory is that either my mom or my dad is a basilisk, but
I’ve got no clue which. I grew up thinking both were human until I came
here to the Demon Realm,” Luz explained.</p>
<p>Ivy sighed. “Whelp, there goes the chances of any of us having a
normal childhood.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?” Luz inquired. She felt like she’d had a
pretty normal childhood. Given, she didn’t have as many friends as other
kids her age, but it wasn’t like she had grown up living in a cage.</p>
<p>“Think about it,” Ivy said. “Since you grew up thinking you were
human, that meant that whichever one of your parents was one of us lied
to you about what you are your entire life.”</p>
<p>“Well, they probably had a good reason for doing it. I don’t care if
one of them was lying to me. Both Mamá and Papá loved me, and I know
that as a fact,” Luz fired back.</p>
<p>Ivy sighed again. “Whatever helps you sleep at night,” she
mumbled.</p>
<p>Luz thought back to what Ivy said. “Wait, what do <em>you</em> mean
when you guys say you didn’t have a normal childhood?”</p>
<p>Ivy opened her mouth to answer, but Tre beat her to the punch. “So,
you know how we’re supposed to be extinct as a species?”</p>
<p>Luz nodded. “Yeah, I’ve heard that fact a few too many times.”</p>
<p>“How do you think we became not extinct?” Tre asked.</p>
<p>Luz wracked her brain, trying to think of a way that a species could
come back from the dead. The closest thing she could come up with was
some mad scientist pulling a <em>Paleozoic Park</em>, but that was just
a movie. There was no way that would actually happen, right?</p>
<p>“Mad science?” Luz supplied, hoping she was wrong.</p>
<p>Tre laughed at the response. “Sure, that’s a way you could describe
it.”</p>
<p>“Tre and I, along with Five and the others, were all born in a lab,”
Ivy explained. “Belos wanted to know how our kind drained magic, so he
had us made through some necromancy-type magic on a basilisk corpse he’d
found in the forest. If ya think about it, that corpse is kinda like our
common parent linking us test tube babies together. Well, except for
Five. She sprung up from the corpse of a Titan-damned child they’d
exhumed from a grave.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Luz?” Eda said, finally speaking up.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Eda?” Luz responded.</p>
<p>“Cover your ears for the next five seconds,” the Owl Lady
instructed.</p>
<p>Luz complied, sticking her fingers in her ears, making her nearly
deaf.</p>
<p>“SHUT THE DUCK!” Eda yelled. Or, at least, that is what Luz hoped she
said. Knowing Eda, though, that sentence was probably a lot spicier.</p>
<p>“Feeling better now?” Luz asked Eda, cautiously withdrawing her
fingers, lest the Owl Lady let out another barrage of swears. Luz
scratched at her cheeks, as the itch had decided to reappear in full
force.</p>
<p>“Barely,” Eda grumbled. “I knew Belos was a deplorable excuse for a
witch, but I didn’t think he would go so low as defiling a child’s
grave.”</p>
<p>“If you think that’s the worst thing he’s done, you are sorely
mistaken,” Ivy said.</p>
<p>Eda massaged her temple. “Oh Titan, what else has he done? Wait, no.
Don’t answer that. I don’t want to go to the Conformatorium on regicide
charges.”</p>
<p>Luz scratched at her throat. Titan, this itching was bugging her to
no end.</p>
<p>“Hey, uh, are you okay?” Tre asked, noticing Luz’s odd behavior.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m fine. Just itchy, that’s all.” Tre didn’t buy the excuse.
He got up close to Luz and inspected her eyes, noting their
cloudiness.</p>
<p>“When’s the last time you shed?” he asked.</p>
<p>It took Luz a solid three seconds to comprehend that question. Why
would she need to shed? It wasn’t like she’s a rept – Wait a minute, she
<em>is</em> a reptile! Luz facepalmed. She had seen Reggie go through
the same things she was going through at least a half dozen times. How
had she not realized it until now? The weird itching, the cloudy eyes,
the decreased vision. It all made sense!</p>
<p>Luz nervously laughed before answering. “Never?”</p>
<p>Tre sighed.</p>
<p>“Well then, kid. Are you ready for the weirdest half hour of your
life?”</p>
<h1 id="luz-peels-her-face-open-like-a-banana">Luz Peels Her Face Open
Like A Banana</h1>
<p><strong>Gehetag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Den of the
Bat Queen</strong></p>
<p>“Alright, Luz, are ya ready for your first molt?”</p>
<p>Tre and Luz had left the main park-like area of the den, now standing
in a secluded spot full of rocks and fallen trees. Eda and Ivy had
similarly gone off to talk about… something, and King had tagged along
with the Owl Lady so that manticore couldn’t bother him anymore.</p>
<p>“Do I have much of a choice?” Luz responded with a question of her
own.</p>
<p>“Eh, not really,” Tre replied. “If it makes you feel any better,
you’re lucky we can do this now before the lubricant starts to dry up.
I’ve had a few bad molts in my time, and they suck big time.”</p>
<p>Luz took a deep breath and exhaled. “Whelp, no time like the present,
I guess. So, what’s step one in basilisk molting? Whenever Reggie would
shed, he would always start by rubbing his cute little snout against his
favorite log.”</p>
<p>Tre looked puzzled at the name. “Who is Reggie?”</p>
<p>“My adorable pet python back home in the Human Realm. He’s only the
cutest baby green tree python in the whole wide world,” Luz
answered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well we’re not doing this the Reggie way,” Tre said.</p>
<p>“What? Why not?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Think about it. Do you want to spend 10 minutes rubbing your head
against a log hoping to open up a large enough hole that you can start
shimmying out of?” Tre asked, rubbing his hand across his cheek,
mimicking the action he described.</p>
<p>“Not really, no,” Luz responded, shaking her head.</p>
<p>Tre slithered over to one of the nearby fallen trees and reached his
hand inside a large hole that had been carved. He withdrew a small
fabric bag, and then from that bag he pulled out an incredibly sharp
looking wood-carving knife. He made his way back over to Luz before
holding out the blade.</p>
<p>“That’s why we have this bad boy.” Tre handed the knife to Luz.</p>
<p>“Woah,” was all Luz could respond with as she received the knife. She
turned it over in her hand, examining it. The handle of the knife had a
smooth finish, and it was engraved with the initials CW. The blade
itself seemed to be made of steel or something similar. Ever so gently
poking the blade into her finger, the sensation Luz felt was odd. It was
like she could feel the blade pressing against her fingertip, but it was
a dull pressure, like she was wearing those special gloves from woodshop
or something.</p>
<p>“When it comes time for Ivy or I to shed, we use this to jumpstart
the process,” Tre explained. “It lets us make sure that we get a clean
separation between the skin we’re shedding and the new one underneath.
It ain’t the prettiest, but it works.” He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“So, I just take this and cut a slit in my face? And then I, what,
peel it open like a banana, or something?” Luz wasn’t exactly sure if
this was the safest way. This felt like something out of horror movie
from the 70s.</p>
<p>“No idea what a banana is, but sure let’s go with that,” Tre said
with a smile.</p>
<p>“Titan, my life has taken a turn for the bizarre. If Mamá saw me
right now, she’d probably have a conniption.” Luz steadied the knife in
her claws. She just had to make one small little cut that would only
pierce the dead layer of skin that was hanging off her body. Nice and
easy. She could totally do this.</p>
<p>“Nope! I can’t do this!” Luz held the knife out as far from her as
possible.</p>
<p>Tre gently took the handle from her outstretched hand. “And that is
totally fine. When I first shed using this method, I nearly took my eye
out with how much my hand was shaking. Do you want me to make the
incision for you?”</p>
<p>Luz gulped. “Yes, please.” She could do this. She could totally do
this. It was just like going to the doctor to get a shot. Except this
was a person she had just met an hour ago slicing her face open, not
poking her in the arm with a needle.</p>
<p>Luz took another deep breath. “Alright, I’m ready. Let’s do it.”</p>
<p>“Good to hear,” Tre said, slithering forward to close the gap between
the two. “Now, fair warning: this is probably going to feel pretty weird
since this is your first time. Just know that if everything goes
smoothly, then you shouldn’t feel any pain whatsoever, maybe a little
pressure at the most. Are you positive and 100% sure that you are
ready?”</p>
<p>Luz nodded.</p>
<p>“Alright. If it will make this any easier, you can close your eyes so
you don’t see the blade. That helped me through my first few sheds,” Tre
said in a calm voice.</p>
<p>“Okay, I can do that,” Luz said, shutting her eyes. She did her best
to remain completely still, but her left hand betrayed her by fidgeting,
her claws tapping against the dead skin she was soon to be rid of.</p>
<p>“Remember, this should only feel like a little pressure,” Luz heard
Tre say. “I’m going to start the incision in 3… 2… 1…”</p>
<p>The blade made contact with Luz’s forehead, being pushed in the
slightest bit. <em>Oh, Titan this feels weird.</em> Tre was true to his
word, though, as Luz wasn’t in any pain. The closest thing she could
compare it to was someone pushing their finger lightly against her
forehead.</p>
<p>Tre slowly moved the knife down until it reached Luz’s nose,
lengthening the cut. He adjusted the blade before continuing the
incision, being especially careful to not give Luz a sudden nose
piercing. Then, he was even more delicate around Luz’s mouth, barely
putting any pressure behind the cut as the blade grazed against her
lips. Finally, Tre maneuvered the blade down Luz’s chin before pulling
back to admire his handiwork.</p>
<p>“And we are done. I’d have to say that was some of my finest work.
How was it?” Luz slowly opened her eyes to see Tre smiling, casually
tossing the knife into the air and catching it by the handle.</p>
<p>“You were right,” Luz said. “That was definitely… an experience. I
thought it was gonna be worse, honestly.” She felt around her face, able
to clearly tell where the knife had been.</p>
<p>“Well, congrats on making it through step one,” Tre replied.
“However, that was the easy part.”</p>
<p>Luz groaned. “Oh Titan, that was the <em>easy</em> part? What’s
next?” She then thought about what she’d seen Reggie do, and she groaned
even louder. “Don’t tell me…”</p>
<p>Tre laughed. “Yup, this next part is more embarrassing than
challenging or painful.”</p>
<p>Luz sighed. “Yeah, well I’ve been embarrassed enough already at
Gravesfield High. What’s the most, I dunno, dignified way to do this
stage of the process?”</p>
<p>Tre exhaled sharply. “There isn’t really a ‘dignified’ way to shed.
If it helps you feel better, know that Ivy and I have both accepted we
look silly doing it. That allows us to just laugh about it after the
fact. Titan, I’m pretty sure Ivy recorded me during a particularly bad
molt and has it listed under ‘Blackmail’ on her scroll.”</p>
<p>“At least that means I won’t be alone in feeling stupid,” Luz said,
letting out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“The sooner you accept it looks stupid, the better, honestly,” Tre
added.</p>
<p>The two stood in silence for a few seconds before Luz spoke up.
“Alright, let’s just get this over with. What do I have to do to finish
molting?”</p>
<p>Tre pointed at a set of extremely long logs placed parallel to each
other, laying about three feet apart. “See those logs over there? That’s
what we use to finish the process. All you gotta do is get down on your
belly and slither between those two extremely slowly. If all goes well,
your molt should catch on to the logs and come right off. You might have
to make a couple passes, though, as sometimes your shed might not feel
like coming off in one piece.”</p>
<p>Luz was somewhat surprised. “Really, that’s all I have to do?”</p>
<p>Tre shrugged. “Pretty much, yeah. Molting isn’t as scary as it first
may seem.”</p>
<p>The duo slithered over to the pair of logs, and Luz examined the
setup. She could probably fit though that with room to spare.</p>
<p>“Are you sure that will be squeeze-y enough?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>Tre tapped a claw on his chin. “You are a bit smaller than us. Good
thing we can just do this.” Tre grabbed one of the logs and rolled it
over, moving it closer to the other.</p>
<p>“Think that’ll work better?” he asked.</p>
<p>Luz did her best to imagine herself slithering through the gap.
“Probably? I dunno, you’re the expert here.”</p>
<p>“I guess the only way to know is to just go for it,” Tre
supplied.</p>
<p>Luz positioned herself in front of the two logs. She then went prone,
laying on her belly and giving her the appearance of an oddly
proportioned snake. Her hands stuck out in front of her, like she was
trying to swim on land.</p>
<p>“So I go through like this?” she asked, turning her head to face
Tre.</p>
<p>“Close, but you’ll actually want to tuck your arms to your side like
this, not have them stick out.” Tre pinned his arms to his side to show
Luz how it should look. “You want your head to go through first so the
molt can start sliding off and then everything else will follow after.
Does that make sense?”</p>
<p>“Ahh, okay. I get it.” Luz copied the other basilisk’s stance. “Like
this?”</p>
<p>“Yup. Now just start slithering through the gap <em>really</em>
slowly,” Tre instructed.</p>
<p>Luz nodded, and began slowly inching her way between the logs. As her
face brushed against the logs, she didn’t feel anything at first.
However, as she moved further down the tunnel, she felt what could only
be described as having her skin slowly detach from the rest of her
body.</p>
<p>It was like that classic trick she would do back in elementary
school. She would get one of those glue bottles and splurt it out all
over hand hand and spread it around. Then, when the glue dried, she
would pick at it until it came off and then she would show her glue skin
to the other kids. That was one of Luz’s favorites! (Mrs. Brandy didn’t
like that, though.)</p>
<p>This time around, though, it was her actual skin that was being
peeled off. Thank the Titan it didn’t hurt. Nevertheless, Luz soldiered
on, slowly slithering forward, with more and more dead skin pooling up
on her back.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of slow progress, Luz noticed that the skin over
her eyes was starting to move. As she slithered forward, the dead eye
caps peeled back, giving Luz a firsthand experience of going from
shoddy, not very good, and annoyingly cloudy vision, back to her normal
vision as the caps peeled away. She didn’t realize how bright and
vibrant the trees were this deep into the forest! The auburn leaves
stood in stark contrast to the brown wood, with small flowers peeking
through the foliage to spruce up the scenery. Luz nearly let out an
audible gasp at how pretty it all was.</p>
<p>But now wasn’t the time to stop and smell the roses, she had a
mission to do, and she had some skin to shed!</p>
<p>Refocusing herself, Luz resumed slowly making her way down the log
tunnel. More and more of her old skin gathering behind her as she
gradually escaped its confines. From what she could see, Luz guessed she
was about halfway done, and there looked to be plenty of log tunnel left
to go to help her out.</p>
<p>With one last wriggle, Luz was free. Slithering forward a few more
feet, she then turned around. There, sandwiched between two logs in the
middle of a forest, lay Luz’s first shed.</p>
<p>“So,” Tre broke the silence, “how do you feel now that you’ve gone
through your first molt?”</p>
<p>Luz took a deep breath and slowly exhaled before answering. “I feel
like a whole new person.” She then chuckled as she looked at her own
dead skin, laying there haphazardly bunched together on the dirt, still
all in one piece. She gently scooped it up and cradled it in her
arms.</p>
<p>“Look, Mom. I finally shed my pajamas.”</p>
<h1 id="interlude-number-five-gets-a-new-name">Interlude: Number Five
Gets A New Name</h1>
<p><strong>Monday, June 14, 2021 | Reality Check Summer Camp | Hoboken,
New Jersey</strong></p>
<p>Number Five awoke with a groan as Masha’s 7:30 alarm blared at full
volume. The song it played was apparently an “absolute classic” from
some band called Ram Stone, or something like that, and Masha had set it
to wake themselves (and everyone else in Cabin 7) up on Mondays. Five
thought that the mix of the whistling and the heavy guitars was an
interesting concept, but it worked well. Given, she couldn’t understand
any of the lyrics, with them being in some foreign language, but the
overall sound was pleasing to her ears.</p>
<p>Marco, however, was not a fan of the song. As he rolled out of bed,
he chucked a small pillow at Masha, who was still asleep somehow. That
was what finally got the goth to awaken and silence the alarm. After
fighting with their blanket for a few seconds, Masha dropped down to the
cabin floor, still donning their typical sleep attire of an oversized
tee-shirt with skulls on it and a pair of baggy sweatpants.</p>
<p>“Can you believe it, Luz? I guess it takes to combined power of
trashy metal <em>and</em> a pillow to wake the dead,” Marco quipped.</p>
<p>“Oh shut it, Marco. You just don’t have good taste,” Masha retorted
sarcastically.</p>
<p>Marco raised his hands defensively. “I’m just saying, would it kill
you to play some Jimmy Money from time to time?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it would. His stuff is too depressing,” Masha fired back.</p>
<p>Marco was in disbelief. “Too depressing? Everything you listen to is
about death and war and –”</p>
<p>“Alright, children, let’s calm down,” Jake interrupted from atop his
bunk, looking out over the side at the offending parties. “We’ve got
breakfast in 30 minutes, so let’s get moving. You can debate which music
genre is the best and which is the evil virus of Satan later.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” Marco grumbled, grabbing his bag after throwing on a tank top
and a pair of shorts.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Jake replied. The bespectacled boy slowly climbed down
from his bunk and slung his backpack over his shoulder, already being
dressed for the day on account of him being an early riser. He and Marco
then left, heading off to the mess hall.</p>
<p>“Are ya coming with, Luz?” Masha asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll be just a minute. You all can go on without me,” Five said.</p>
<p>“Alright, suit yourself. Just don’t get lost and end up locked in a
broom closet,” Masha replied.</p>
<p>Five blushed. “That was one time, okay! It wasn’t my fault the doors
were labelled weird.”</p>
<p>Masha laughed. “I know, I’m just messing with ya. Well, I’m gonna
head out. There are some waffles that have my name on ‘em.” With that
parting message, Masha left leaving Number Five alone in the cabin.</p>
<p>Finally deciding it was time to get out of bed, Five scooched over to
the side of the bed and stood up. However, she hadn’t scooched out far
enough, as her head collided with the metal bar holding up Masha’s
mattress.</p>
<p>“Oh sweet mother of Titan!” Five exclaimed, breathing in sharply
through gritted teeth. She rubbed at her head as the pain began to
slowly subside. Thankfully, pulling her hand away revealed that she
wasn’t bleeding, so at least she didn’t need to stop by the nurse’s
office. Closing her eyes tightly and massaging her scalp a little more,
Five slowly exhaled. That was the fourth time (at least) that she’d
banged her head against that stupid metal bar.</p>
<p>Recomposing herself, Five saw that the sudden meeting between her
skull and the bottom of Masha’s bed had knocked one of the goth’s books
onto the floor. Five bent down so that she could place the book back on
the bed of its owner, but the cover caught her attention.</p>
<p><em>V for Vengeance</em> the title proclaimed in bright red coloring,
featuring a close-up illustration of a masked figure sporting a black
fedora. The mask the person on the cover was wearing was highly
detailed, with pale, rosy cheeks contrasting against the ominous smile
the mask had permanently on display. The mask also sported thick,
arching eyebrows and a quite odd choice of facial hair, in Five’s
opinion. A handlebar mustache and an incredibly thin goatee was
certainly a look, but not a good one.</p>
<p>Turning over to see if there was anything on the back cover, Five
found a short blurb of text in large white print, standing on a solid
black background. <em>He was once called The Man from Room Five, but now
he is called… V!</em></p>
<p>V, huh? Five thought back to the time before. Back when she was in
the Demon Realm, she had never been given a name. she was always just
“Basilisk Number Five”, “Number Five”, or “Experiment Five”. But now,
though? She had a name. Well, she had actually taken someone else's
name, but that was a train of thought for another day. When someone
would call for Luz Noceda, she would be who they were looking for.
Having an actual name was nice. Five liked it. She placed the book back
on Masha's bed before an idea struck her. Maybe she didn't have to be
Number Five <em>or</em> Luz Noceda!</p>
<p>She quickly scrounged around in her backpack before pulling out a
piece of paper and a pencil. Laying the page down on Marco’s
mini-fridge, she used it as a makeshift desk and began to write.</p>
<p><em>My name is Numbe</em>r</p>
<p>She couldn’t even finish writing that sentence before she scribbled
it out with the pencil. No. Number Five was dead for all she cared.</p>
<p><em><del>My name is Number<br />
</del> My name is Luz</em></p>
<p>That was a lie, though. She wasn’t Luz Noceda. The real Luz Noceda
was somewhere in the Demon Realm, not here at camp. The basilisk struck
through that line as well.</p>
<p><em><del>My name is Number<br />
My name is Luz<br />
</del> My name is V</em></p>
<p>That looked… okay, but she didn’t want to just blatantly copy the
name from that book character. She had to make it her own. But the name
sounded so right to her! After staring at the only unscribbled line on
the page, she decided to make a small adjustment. She wanted the
pronunciation to stay the same, but she wanted to give the name a more
unique spelling then just one letter. So, she tacked two “e”s on to the
end.</p>
<p><em><del>My name is Number<br />
My name is Luz<br />
</del> My name is Vee</em></p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<h1 id="luz-makes-a-truly-magical-lunch">Luz Makes A Truly Magical
Lunch</h1>
<p><strong>Gehetag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Den of the
Bat Queen</strong></p>
<p>Luz and Tre slowly made their way back to the main section of the Bat
Queen’s den, with Luz still carrying her molt in her arms. It needed to
be commemorated, and she wasn’t going to let her very first shed be
eaten up by the local wildlife. Maybe she could hang it up on the wall
next to Eda’s giant wanted poster? It could be kind of like how Mamá
kept that Garter snake skin in a frame on her nightstand. Yeah, that
would be awesome! It would totally match the whole “absolute chaos and
randomness” aesthetic Eda had.</p>
<p>As the pair entered the main park, Luz could see Eda and Ivy talking
about something, with Eda holding a few sheets of paper and Ivy
occasionally pointing to specific things on those pages. King, who was a
fair distance away, looked to be taking a nap under one of the numerous
trees, his tail curled up under him, and his paws acting as a makeshift
pillow.</p>
<p>“Hey, Eda! Look what I have!” Luz called out to the Owl Lady, holding
up her shed skin for all to see. The witch turned at the call of her
name to see her apprentice practically speed-slithering over to her,
dead skin in hand.</p>
<p>“Look at it! It’s so cool!” Luz could barely contain her excitement
as she handed the molt over to Eda. The Owl Lady gingerly inspected the
skin, careful to not damage it in the slightest. The skin itself was
nearly see-through, but Eda could make out the general imprint of Luz’s
scales. Eda handed the skin back to Luz after giving it one last
look.</p>
<p>Eda chuckled and ruffled Luz’s hair, which earned a smile from the
girl. “I knew you had it in ya, kid. So how was it?”</p>
<p>“It was so weird, but so awesome at the same time!” Luz exclaimed.
“Like, Tre had this knife that we used to cut my face open, and there
was this log tunnel that I went through that would catch onto my molt,
and then I would slither out of it super slowly, and it felt so odd, but
when I finished I felt all better.”</p>
<p>“Dang kid, remember to breathe, won’t ya.” Eda said once her
apprentice finished rambling.</p>
<p>“Hehe, sorry,” Luz apologized. “It was just so cool!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, I get it,” Eda said. “Well, while you and your buddy
were off playing with knives, Ivy and I had a very productive
conversation about how I can keep you from not passing out because you
forget to eat. Hooty won’t always be there to save you, ya know?”</p>
<p>“I know,” Luz replied. “and, uh, sorry about that, by the way.”</p>
<p>“What is there to be sorry for?” Eda asked rhetorically. “You screwed
up and made a mistake, but now you’re learning from it. Look, kid.
You’re a basilisk, so that means you gotta have some magic in ya. I said
it before, and I’ll say it again: you aren’t gonna be eating me out of
the house just because I have to cook up something with a little extra
magic in it. We’ve got bloodberries, fairies, and way more that you can
use to fill your gut with morphing juice.”</p>
<p>Luz suddenly wrapped Eda up in a hug, which the Owl Lady
reciprocated, giving the basilisk a few pats on the back.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Eda,” Luz said before breaking off the embrace.</p>
<p>“Eh, don’t mention it, kid. Titan, you’re making me all soft and
mushy with so many of these parallel arm things,” Eda replied, only
partially in jest.</p>
<p>“Hey, Eda, is it okay if we put my molt in your hair pocket dimension
thing?” Luz asked. She wanted to keep it safe and her mentor’s hair was
probably the best bet.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, yeah sure. Hand it over.” Luz complied, and the Owl Lady
rummaged around in her hair a bit before withdrawing her hand.</p>
<p>“Alright, your shed is safe and sound. Do you wanna keep it or
something?” Eda asked in kind.</p>
<p>“Pretty much, yeah,” Luz replied. “Since it’s my first one, I feel
like it’s special. I don’t wanna just throw it away and let some random
fairy eat it.”</p>
<p>An alarm went off on Eda’s scroll. Eda summoned the device to see
what the cause of the disturbance was. <em>Potion for M. Rasmodius
Ready</em>, the screen read. Oh yeah, she had potions to make. The Owl
Lady let out a groan.</p>
<p>Eda turned to Ivy. “While I would love to stay and keep chatting,
I’ve got some work I gotta finish up.” She then looked towards Luz. “Can
you go wake up King, kid? We’re heading home.”</p>
<p>Luz opened her mouth to object to them going home so soon (She had
just met other basilisks! Couldn’t she have another hour?), but shut her
mouth and complied with Eda’s request. The young girl slithered over to
the sleeping demon and gently shook his shoulder, rousing him from his
slumber.</p>
<p>“Come on, buddy, you gotta get up. Eda says we’re going home.” To
that, King slowly go to his feet and slowly yawned.</p>
<p>“I’m tired…” the King of Demons (and Luz’s heart) said.</p>
<p>“I know,” Luz replied. Then, an idea struck her. “Would a piggyback
ride make you feel better?”</p>
<p>King’s eyes lit up instantly at the offer. “Yeah!”</p>
<p>Luz smiled. “Alright, hop on!”</p>
<p>King scrambled up onto Luz’s back before hooking his arms around her
neck like the world’s fluffiest cape. “Away, fair chariot!” he
proclaimed, which earned a laugh from Luz.</p>
<p>As the pair returned back to the others, Ivy stopped Luz. “I know we
didn’t get to talk much, and I know this is kinda a long shot, but if
you ever see Five, can you tell her that Tre and I are okay and with the
Bat Queen?”</p>
<p>“And that we miss her!” Tre added.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that too,” Ivy said.</p>
<p>“Totally!” Luz replied. “I’ll be sure to keep a lookout.” Luz gave
the other two basilisks a salute</p>
<p>“Hey Tiny One, Tiny Two, are ya ready to go?” Eda called out. “My
potions aren’t gonna bottle themselves, and unless one of you is gonna
sprout a pair of wings in the next five minutes, I’m your only ticket
home.”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Eda, we’re coming.”</p>
<p>As Owlbert descended from the sky and slowly touched down, Eda and
Luz (with King still riding on her back) quickly hopped off the
Palisman. It was only when the three went through the front door of the
Owl House that King finally ended what felt like the world’s longest
piggyback ride, clambering down to the floor before just as quickly
climbing up onto the couch.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’m gonna be in the kitchen finishing up Rasmodius’ order,”
Eda announced. “That means you two get to pick what we do for lunch. No
burgers, though. I’m getting sick of having to fend off Hooty from
eating the patties every ten seconds.”</p>
<p>“BUT THEY’RE SO DELICIOUS, HOOT HOOT!”</p>
<p>Luz joined King on the couch, draping her tail over the armrest. The
two sat in relative silence for a few seconds before Luz spoke up.</p>
<p>“So, what do you want for lunch?” she asked the diminutive demon.</p>
<p>“Hmm…” King tapped a claw against his chin. “Spaghetti and
heatballs?”</p>
<p>“Eh, I feel like we just had that, though,” Luz replied, shooting
down the offer. Plus, the heatballs weren’t the kindest to her stomach
when she tried them the way King liked them: absolutely drenched in hot
sauce to the point of being more of a stew then a pasta dish.</p>
<p>Wait… stew. That gave Luz an idea. “I know, we can make some
<em>sancocho</em>!” the basilisk proclaimed.</p>
<p>“What’s ‘san-co-cho’?” King asked, sounding out each syllable of the
foreign word.</p>
<p>Luz gasped. “<em>Sancocho</em> is only one of the best foods in all
of existence! It’s a stew you cook up with chunks of beef and chicken,
along with some yuca, plantain, auyama, and a ton of downright heavenly
spices. Mami and I would always make some together on rainy days back
home, and it always turned out incredible.” Her mouth was watering at
the mere thought of the dish., but then she thought some more and
realized that they weren’t any cows or chickens on the Boiling Isles.
“We’ll probably have to make a few substitutions, though,” the basilisk
added quickly after.</p>
<p>“Mmm… sounds yummy. Let’s do it!” King said.</p>
<p>“Cool,” Luz replied, before calling into the kitchen. “Eda, we know
what we wanna do for lunch!”</p>
<p>“Alright, but I’ll still need about half an hour to finish up this
last order,” Eda responded.</p>
<p>Luz slithered into the kitchen, with King following close behind. Eda
stood next to a bubbling cauldron filled to the brim with a light green
liquid. Dozens of potion bottles were strewn about on the counter, with
some filled, but most were empty.</p>
<p>“So what’s the plan?” Eda asked, dipping a bottle into the
cauldron.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna make a really good stew called <em>sancocho</em>. It’s
got chunks of meat, fruits, veggies, and lots of spices,” Luz explained.
While she did so, she scoured the cabinets, pulling out a mixing bowl
that was large enough to marinate the meat in, as well as grabbing a pot
that could hold all the ingredients once everything was cooking.</p>
<p>Now it was time to actually prepare the ingredients. First, though,
Luz thoroughly washed her hands. She didn’t want to risk contaminating
anything, after all. Opening some more cabinets, Luz set out a bottle of
lime juice, a few sprigs of cilantro, some oregano, a clove of garlic,
and a salt shaker. There was a problem, though, as Luz had no idea what
substitutes they had readily available as a beef stand-in.</p>
<p>“Hey, Eda, do we have any meats by chance?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’ve got some griffin flank in the fridge,” Eda replied,
motioning with her ladle.</p>
<p>Luz pondered that for a second. She knew griffins laid eggs (which
were quite tasty in her opinion), so maybe griffin flank would taste
like chicken? It was worth a shot. Luz opened the fridge and looked
around before spotting a wrapped package with “GRIFFIN” written on it in
marker. Jackpot. Luz took out the flank and unwrapped it, untying the
string and drawing back the brown paper. <em>Ooh, this looks
fantastic!</em> Luz thought.</p>
<p>Reaching under the stove-top, Luz grabbed a cutting board and chef’s
knife. Setting the flank in the center of the board, Luz began to slice
the meat into small chunks. If she was back home, mamá would be the one
doing the knife-work, but here Eda was busy, and she didn’t trust King
to not hurt himself, so that left Luz. Like she had hoped, the griffin
flank had about the same consistency as a chicken’s, which allowed the
knife to effortlessly glide through as she made her cuts. When Luz
finally put the knife down, she had around 3 dozen chunks of griffin on
her cutting board, which meant there was plenty to go around for her,
Eda, and King.</p>
<p>After placing the used knife in the sink and depositing the
now-sliced griffin flank in the mixing bowl, Luz began preparing the
marinade. First into the concoction went the cilantro and the oregano.
Then she added a few shakes of salt. Luz always liked her chicken (or,
in this case, griffin) on the saltier side, so she hoped the the other’s
wouldn’t mind. She still had to prepare the garlic, though, so Luz got
out a smaller knife and trimmed the ends of the the clove before
crushing it and removing the skin. Once the garlic was finely smushed,
she added it to the mixing bowl. For the final touch on the marinade,
about a lime’s worth of juice was added to the mix.</p>
<p>Now that the marinade was ready, Luz began working the mixture
together with her hands, making sure that every chunk of griffin got
properly coated. Once the meat was seasoned to Luz’s liking, she set the
bowl in the fridge to let all the flavors seep into the griffin chunks.
After another quick hand wash to clean off the germs and juices, Luz
took a moment to appreciate her work so far. <em>Ooh, this is gonna be
SO GOOD!</em> she thought.</p>
<p>Since she had some free time while waiting for the griffin to
marinate, Luz slithered over to check on Eda, who was busy filling the
last of the potion bottles.</p>
<p>“So do most people usually order this many potions?” Luz asked,
eyeing the large quantity of bottles crowding the table.</p>
<p>“Not really,” Eda answered. “Ras always likes to do one giant bulk
order every few years. It may take a long while to fulfill the order,
but once its delivered he doesn’t bother me until he needs to re-up.
Pays top snail, too, so I make sure to get his done with high quality
stuff.”</p>
<p>“Huh, that’s cool,” Luz replied. “Well, the griffin’s marinating in
the fridge,” she continued, pointing her thumb over shoulder in the
direction of the fridge. “It should be ready for cooking in about an
hour, so I’m just gonna reread some <em>Azura</em> for the time
being.”</p>
<p>After slithering into the living room and crawling up onto the couch,
Luz looked into her backpack and pondered which one she should start
reading. <em>The Field of Deadly Fates</em> was pretty good, but Luz was
on a time crunch, and <em>Deadly Fates</em> was notorious for how long
it took to get into the main plot. She wasn’t really feeling <em>The
Darkness Strikes Back</em>, so that one was out as well. Luz would have
opted for <em>The Fall of Zargothrax</em>, but then she remembered that
she had given her copy to Amity. Luz hoped that the emerald-haired witch
was finding as much enjoyment in the book as Luz had when she had
initially read it. Luz especially liked <em>The Fall of Zargothrax</em>
since that was the book where Hecate and Azura had officially become a
couple. (Maybe Luz would someday find someone to be the Hecate to her
Azura? That was a foolish thought, though.) Deciding to let fate decide,
Luz stared up at the ceiling and grabbed a book at random. <em>Revenge
of the Gildersnake</em>. Could have been worse, honestly.</p>
<p>Setting a 45 minute timer on her phone, Luz curled up, resting her
head on her tail, and began reading.</p>
<p><em>Azura was beginning to question her title as a truly Good
Witch.</em></p>
<p><em>“Your reign of terror ends now, Gildersnake!” Azura shouted. She
leveled her staff to her shoulder and</em></p>
<p>The alarm Luz had set went of, the incessant beeping drawing her
attention away from the book. That meant the griffin should be ready for
cooking.</p>
<p>Slithering into the kitchen, Luz found that Eda had cleared the table
in preparation for lunch and was now absentmindedly looking at posts on
her Penstagram. After going over to the sink and washing her hands, Luz
opened the fridge and pulled out the griffin. It looked perfectly done.
Luz surmised that all the times she had hovered Mamá while she cooked
had paid off.</p>
<p>Now it was time to start cooking with gas!</p>
<p>Grabbing the large pot from before, Luz added a few tablespoons of
vegetable oil and turned the heat on to high. After the pot got to the
right temperature, she added the griffin chunks in, grabbed a ladle, and
began stirring. She was being careful with her stirring, though, as she
had seen Mamá get splashed by hot oil a few times before, and those
looked like they hurt big time.</p>
<p>As the minutes passed, the griffin began to brown nicely, which meant
it was time to add the water in. Lowering the heat to medium and
grabbing a measuring cup, Luz added 4 cups worth of water to the pot and
waited for it to start boiling.</p>
<p>“Hey, Eda, do we have any yuca or squash?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Hmm?” Eda looked up from her scroll before comprehending the
questino. “Oh, yeah we’ve got some. Yuca’s in the bottom left cabinet by
the stove, and there should be some squash in the top drawer of the
fridge.”</p>
<p>Luz looked in those locations and did indeed find the ingredients she
needed. Grabbing another clean cutting board and a knife, she then went
to work slicing the two into inch-long pieces, making them big enough so
that King (who was notoriousy stingy about his food) could pick them out
if he so chooses.</p>
<p>Once the pot came to a boil, Luz slid all the chopped yuca and squash
in with the scrape of a knife. Fishing out a properly-sized lid, she
then covered the pot and turned the heat down to low. After another few
minutes of waiting around, the broth had finally began to take shape.
Now was Luz’s favorite part: taste testing!</p>
<p>“Eda, come over here and tell me how this tastes.” The Owl Lady
obliged, making her way over to the pot of <em>sancocho</em>. Luz took
the lid off so Eda could get a spoonful of broth.</p>
<p>As Eda mulled over the flavor profile, she clicked her tongue three
times. “Hot dang, kid that is some good stuff. But do you know what will
make it even better?”</p>
<p>“What?” Luz replied. She had tried to follow Mamaá’s recipe as
faithfully as she could given the circumstance.</p>
<p>“A little bit of heat,” the Owl Lady said. She then searched around
in her hair before pulling out a tiny bottle. Uncapping it, she let a
few drops fall into the stew.</p>
<p>After stirring the pot to spread the hot sauce around, Luz took her
own spoonful and tried the updated broth. It was incredible!</p>
<p>“This tastes great, Mamá!” Luz exclaimed.</p>
<p>And then she realized what she said.</p>
<p>Morphing human and running up the stairs, Luz slammed the door to her
room.</p>
<p><em>Mierda</em>.</p>
<h1 id="luz-contemplates-the-possibility-of-having-two-moms">Luz
Contemplates The Possibility of Having Two Moms</h1>
<p><strong>Gehetag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Luz threw herself onto her bed and buried her face into a pillow.
After a few seconds of muffled screaming, she flipped over and stared at
the ceiling.</p>
<p><em>Titan, why did I just do that?</em></p>
<p>In all her time at school, she had never once called a teacher “Mom”.
She had always made sure to call her teachers by their title, and she
wouldn’t be caught dead calling any of them the title that was reserved
solely for Camila Noceda. If that had ever happened and word got out, it
would have been a social death sentence. Plus, it would have just given
more ammunition to Taylor and her cronies. It was already bad enough
that they had decided that banding her with the moniker of “Luz-er” was
the funniest thing ever, and they would probably think that “Momma’s
girl” was even more of a knee-slapper. So, yeah, Luz would wade through
the guts of every trash slug on the Isles before she would ever call any
of her teachers “Mom.”</p>
<p>Yet she had just called Eda “Mamá.”</p>
<p><em>I mean, it’s not like Eda isn’t motherly. Even if it is in her
own Eda way.</em></p>
<p>Luz thought back to all the fun things that she, Eda, and King had
done together. There were the big things they had done, like the prison
break at the Conformatorium, not to mention the whole ordeal she had
just gone through just hours earlier with Tre, Ivy, and the Bat Queen.
But there were also the smaller things that Luz had enjoyed as well,
like watching trashy soap operas on the CB or pulling pranks on
unsuspecting Emperor’s Coven scouts. Luz wasn’t exactly watching
<em>Wheel of Misfortune</em> with Mr. Berenson on the reg back in
Gravesfield. Those weren’t things you did with someone who was just your
teacher. Those were things you did with a parent.</p>
<p>But that brought up a whole new quandary for Luz to deal with. If she
was beginning to see Eda as a mother figure (and that was a giant if),
what did that mean she saw Camila as? It wasn’t like she could have two
moms, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>A knock at her bedroom door snapped Luz out of whatever silly funk
she was in. The voice of the Owl Lady could be heard through the
wood.</p>
<p>“Hey, Luz. You up for a talk?” Eda asked, making sure to stay in the
doorway and not intrude on the basilisk’s space.</p>
<p>Luz propped herself up on her elbows and took a deep breath to
compose herself before answering. “Sure, come on in.”</p>
<p>Eda slowly opened the door, carrying a bowl of sancocho in her free
arm. After placing the bowl down on Luz’s bedside table, she took a seat
on the foot of Luz’s bed. “Look, kid. I may not speak Spain-ish, or
whatever that language is, but I’m pretty sure you called me Mom back
there. Is that right?”</p>
<p>Luz nodded. “Yeah,” she responded quietly.</p>
<p>Eda let out a long exhale. “Well dang, kid. Didn’t know you thought
so highly of me,” she said with a smirk, before growing serious. “Look,
Luz. If you want to call me Mom, Mamá, whatever, I’m cool with that.
Call me whatever you’re comfortable with, whether that be ‘Eda’, ‘Owl
Lady’, or anything in between. Well, except ‘Edalyn’. Only my parents
and Lily get to call me that and live. Anything else is fair game,
though. That sound good to you?”</p>
<p>Luz sat up. “Yeah, that sounds okay. I think I’m going to stick with
‘Eda’ though, if that’s alright.”</p>
<p>Eda got off the bed and onto her feet. “It is. Well, King and I are
going to be in the kitchen munching on the rest of the san-co-cho, and
if you want seconds you’re more than free to come on down.” With a grin
and a flash of her signature gold fang, Eda quietly closed the door to
Luz’s room, leaving the basilisk alone with her thoughts yet again.</p>
<p>Draping her legs over the side of the bed and grabbing the bowl of
sancocho that Eda had left, Luz took a test bite. The broth had somehow
gotten even better now that the hot sauce that Eda supplied had mixed
fully with the existing elements, and the spice had taken the flavor to
another level. The griffin chunks were also exquisite, having just the
right mix of tenderness and chewiness. Taking another spoonful, Luz
tried the yuca and squash, both of which were excellent as well. She had
to admit that this was some of the best sancocho she had ever had.
Given, it wasn’t as good as Camila’s, but that was an impossibly high
bar to surpass.</p>
<p>Before Luz could realize what was happening, she finished the bowl in
record time. Deciding it was finally time to rejoin society, Luz
returned to the kitchen and placed the empty bowl and spoon in the sink.
Eda and King had apparently found the sancocho as good as she did, as
the pot that once held the meal was in the sink as well. It was empty,
save for a few stray chunks of squash.</p>
<p>Moving into the living room, Luz found Eda and King on the couch,
both enraptured by a show on the crystal ball. Making her presence known
to the two, Luz plopped down in front of the couch and took a seat with
her legs crossed.</p>
<p>“What show is this?” Luz didn’t recognize the character onscreen.
Currently, a witch (like, the stereotypical Earth version of a witch,
green skin and all) had a lit firework situated in a bucket of paint
inside what was presumably their house. Luz had no idea what they were
trying to do, but Eda apparently found it hilarious.</p>
<p>“<em>Mr. Legume</em>,” Eda answered between fits of laughter.</p>
<p>“Yeah, this guy’s super funny!” King added, barely able to stop
himself from laughing alongside the Owl Lady.</p>
<p>On the CB, Mr. Legume sat nestled in a corner, ears plugged, waiting
for the firework to go off. Unbeknownst to him, though, his palisman (a
snorse) had decided it was hungry for a snack and had flown into the
kitchen. Unfortunately, that was where tha paint bucket and firework
was, so when Mr. Legume heard the firework go off and returned to his
kitchen, he found it completely covered except for a snorse-shaped
section that was free of paint.</p>
<p>Luz had to admit that, even though there wasn’t much dialogue to the
show, the facial expressions and slapstick comedy more than made up for
it. As she watched episode after episode with Eda and King, Luz slowly
grew tired. Grabbing her tail behind her (<em>When did you show up?</em>
Luz thought) and using it as a pillow, the human-basilisk hybrid decided
it was a good time to take a nap.</p>
<p>Some time later, Luz awoke to now find herself on the couch, swaddled
up in blankets like some kind of Luz burrito. Sunlight was streaming
through the window of the living room, so she at least knew it was still
daytime. <em>Mr. Legume</em> was still playing, and now the titular
character was up to his wacky hijinks at a healer’s ward. Emerging from
her blanket cocoon, Luz let out a yawn and rubbed at her eyes. She
grabbed the CB remote and turned off the device.</p>
<p>How long had she been out?</p>
<p>Shuffling into the kitchen, her tail laying limp behind her, Luz
grabbed an apple from the fruit bowl on the counter and took a bite.
Taking a seat at the table so she could finish her snack, Luz saw a note
that had been left out for her. Shifting the apple to her left hand, she
picked up the slip of paper and began to read it.</p>
<p><em>King and I are out shopping, and we probably won’t be back until
midnight, so you’re home alone for the time being. (The bird worm
doesn’t count.) That means you are responsible for feeding yourself
dinner and whatever snacks you may want. If you don’t feel up to cooking
for yourself, I’ve left you twenty snails to have some Taco Hell or
whatever delivered. (Or you could be like King and blow it on
Sin-A-Bun.) The money is in the top left cabinet. Didn’t want the little
gremlin to swipe it for himself when my back was turned, so I had to put
it up high. Anyways, be sure to stay safe, make good choices, yada yada
yada.</em></p>
<p><em>- Eda</em></p>
<p>Taking another bite of her apple, Luz flipped over the note to see if
there was anything on the other side, but there wasn’t. Rising from her
seat and checking the indicated cabinet, she indeed found a twenty-snail
bill. Pocketing the money, she turned to look at the clock hanging above
the stove. It was nearing dinner time. Dang, she must have been out for
at least six hours. Her body must have really needed that nap.</p>
<p>Luz’s stomach rumbled. Okay, it was time for dinner. However, she
didn’t really feel up to the task of cooking for herself, so ordering
off the CB it was. Walking back into the living room, Luz took another
large bite of the apple to tide herself over. Grabbing the CB remote and
turning the device back on, she toggled over to the search function.</p>
<p>Hmm… what would be a good dinner for cheap? She wasn’t feeling Taco
Hell, as the Hell it put her through was in the bathroom. She also
doubted there was a Boiling Isles equivalent to McRonald’s, so that was
off the menu as well. Maybe there was a pizza joint that would deliver
to the Owl House? It was worth a shot.</p>
<p>Typing “pizza” into the search bar, Luz waited to see if there were
any results. Surprisingly, there were. There weren’t many good ones,
though. Uncle Jim’s Pizza had five stars, but that was only based on
twelve reviews, so Luz was wary. Tiny Tyrant Pizza was on the other side
of the spectrum, with a lot of reviews, but most of them being negative
or mediocre. The only place that Luz could find with a substantial
amount of reviews that leaned toward the positive side was Hellfire
Pies, so that was the one she chose.</p>
<p>Navigating to the company’s page, Luz scrolled around until she found
the “Order Now!” button. Once she pressed that, she was taken to another
page where she crafted her order. It was a little disorienting when she
was picking what she wanted on her pie, since there would be something
so normal to her, like a tomato sauce for the base, but right next to
that would be the alternative option of abomination goop. Luz didn’t
even think that stuff was edible! Nevertheless, the basilisk eventually
settled on a small thin-crust pizza with tomato sauce, griffin cheese
(Thank Titan she didn’t inherit her mother’s lactose intolerance.), and
toppings of ratworm chunks, griffin slices, pepperoncini, plus a
sprinkling of onion for good measure. While it might not have been the
traditional pepperoni or plain cheese that Luz was used to, she might as
well expand her palette while in another realm. After finalizing the
order, Luz flipped the CB back over to broadcast mode to see what was
playing.</p>
<p>“PIZZA’S HERE HOOT HOOT!”</p>
<p>Muting the episode of <em>Reptilia</em> and slowly walking over to
the, Luz fished the twenty snails out of her pocket and opened the front
door. On the doorstep of the Owl House stood a younger witch who barely
looked to be out of their teenage years, a pizza box in one hand and a
snail collection jar in the other. (How the Isles hadn’t figured out the
concept of a credit card yet, Luz would never know.)</p>
<p>“I’ve got a small build-your-own pie for Liz Nokayda,” the witch
said, reading off the receipt.</p>
<p>“Luz Noceda,” the girl replied, correcting the pronunciation, “but,
yeah, that’s me.”</p>
<p>The delivery witch handed Luz her pizza, and she could already smell
the cheesy goodness inside. “Your total is thirteen snails.”</p>
<p>Luz handed over the twenty-snail bill, which the delivery witch took
before looking in the collection jar to fetch the basilisk her change.
As the witch moved to hand the girl back her seven snails, they noticed
that she had human ears.</p>
<p>“Wait a second, are you a –”</p>
<p><em>Oh crud,</em> Luz thought, <em>I forgot to morph witch
ears!</em></p>
<p>“I’ll let you keep the change if you don’t mention me to anyone,
ever,” Luz interrupted before the witch could finish their question.</p>
<p>The witch just stared at Luz before slowly depositing the seven
snails in their own pocket. “Alright, deal. I need the cash,
anyway.”</p>
<p>“Okay, thank you, bye!” Luz said quickly before slamming the door in
their face.</p>
<p>Phew! Crisis averted!</p>
<p>Setting the pizza on the coffee table in front of the CB and cranking
the volume back up, Luz grabbed a paper plate from the kitchen before
resuming her spot on the couch. Taking a slice from the pizza box, the
pie had come out perfect. Today might have been wild and crazy, but
right now she had pizza, a funny animated show on the CB, and life was
good.</p>
<h1 id="alex-instantly-blows-her-cover">“Alex” Instantly Blows Her
Cover</h1>
<p><strong>Gehetag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Eda cracked open the front door to her home before peeking her head
inside. Yup, just as she had expected. Luz was passed out, laying
horizontal on the couch. In the background, the CB droned on with some
conspiracy theory about mind-controlling slugs while the basilisk dreamt
about <em>Good Witch Azura</em> or whatever. An occasional snore forced
its way out, breaking the look of serenity on the girl’s face. As Eda
quietly got closer, she noticed that the kid was hugging her own tail
like some kind of stuffed animal, and the faintest of smiles could be
seen on her face as she slept.</p>
<p><em>Aww, she looks so cute with her</em> – <em>NO! Stop it, Edalyn!
You can’t get so attached to the kid.</em></p>
<p>Eda shook her head to clear the intrusive thought.</p>
<p><em>Not yet, anyway.</em></p>
<p>Now was not the time to be all lovey-dovey.</p>
<p>King scampered over to the coffee table and grabbed something from a
box that Eda hadn’t noticed. Pulling out a slice of pizza (<em>Oh, so
that’s what the kid bought.</em>), the tiny tyrant went to wolf down the
pie before he caught Eda’s gaze, the Owl Lady shaking her head to tell
him no. The little gremlin had eaten his fair share (and then some) of
the chocolate-covered coffee beans that Eda had bought from O’Malley’s.
He didn’t need more food to keep him up into the early hours of the next
day. With big, sad puppy-dog eyes, King slowly put the pizza back in the
box.</p>
<p>Stealing a glance at the CB, Eda saw that it was nearing midnight,
which meant it was time for everyone to go to sleep. (Well, Luz was
already asleep so it was time for her to get in bed.) As such, Eda first
closed the pizza box before storing it in the fridge. Maybe they could
have some for lunch? Then, she switched off the CB. Luz’s brain was
probably rotting from all that conspiracy junk that was playing.</p>
<p>Squatting down, Eda hooked her arms under Luz and scooped the
basilisk up bridal-style. At this sudden jostling from her sleeping
position, Luz buried her head in the crook of Eda’s arm, as if this was
no different from her spot on the couch. Slowly, Eda carried the girl
across the living room and into the kitchen before she began to climb
the stairs. Suddenly, when the two were halfway up the stairs, Luz,
still asleep and unaware of her surroundings, said something.</p>
<p>“<em>Gracias mamá. Te amo</em>,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>Eda froze. There was that word again. And some other stuff she didn’t
quite understand, but she got the message anyway. She stood still for
what felt like forever. No, she was not going to cry. She was not! She
was the Owl Lady, dang it! Steeling herself, Eda completed the trek up
the stairs and deposited Luz in her bed before drawing the blankets over
her now-sleeping-again body. From seemingly out of nowhere, King hopped
up onto Luz’s bed and plopped down after getting comfy. Within seconds,
Eda was the only one awake in the house.</p>
<p>After collapsing into her nest, Eda thought about what had happened
today. And then she ugly cried. Hard.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Kriegstag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Luz’s eyes fluttered open as the light of the morning sun streamed
through her window. Wait, she’s in her bed. Hadn’t she passed out on the
couch? The last thing she rememberd was laughing at the demon on the TV
who was ranting about some stupid conspiracy theory involving giraffes.
Maybe Eda had carried her up when she and King had returned from the
store? That was probably it. Eda was nice like that, even though she put
up a grumpy façade.</p>
<p>Deciding it was time to face the day, Luz rolled out of bed, her tail
falling to the floor with a loud <em>THWAP</em> after a few steps. Oh,
she still had that. After questioning whether or not to morph it away,
she decided to keep it. She may be half human, but the other half of her
is basilisk, so it was only right that she got to show off both sides of
her heritage, just like how Mamí had both Puerto Rican and Domincan
flags in the house.</p>
<p>Now Luz was faced with an even bigger question: what to wear. The
weather report had said that it was supposed to be insanely hot out, so
any shirts with long sleeves or pants with long legs were instantly a no
go. She eventually decided that a tank top and athletic shorts were
probably her best outfit to beat the heat.</p>
<p>As Luz gave her outfit for the day a once over, a thought struck her.
What exactly did happen when she morphed? That book in the library had
said it was like a full-body, corporeal illusion, but that didn’t
explain everything. Like, when she morphed something larger than her
natural state, like a horse or the Kraugh, where did all that new body
mass come from? Was there some sort of anti-reality dimension thingy
that just stored blobs of mass for any random basilisk to use when they
needed to gain a few pounds to complete a disguise or something? That
was probably something she would have to ask to Tre or Ivy whenever she
saw them again.</p>
<p>After a quick stop in the bathroom to brush her teeth, Luz descended
the stairs to see what everyone else in the house was up to.</p>
<p>King was on the couch, the portal door open next to him, and he had
stolen her phone so he could videos of kittens fighting each other.
Given, her phone’s reception kinda sucked out here in a different realm
(<em>Thanks a lot, Horizon</em>, Luz thought sarcastically.), so the
best video quality she could get was around 480p on a good day.
Nevertheless, the cat videos brought King joy, so she would let him
stealing her phone slide.</p>
<p>“AH HAH! YES! DEATH IS YOUR GOD!” King shouted as the orange tabby
lightly batted the maltese on the nose and rolled over. Luz chuckled at
the tiny demon’s reaction.</p>
<p>A sudden knock at the door drew Luz’s attention. Going over and
opening it revealed one Gus Porter.</p>
<p>“Hey, Gustanamo. What brings you to <em>La Casa Búho</em>?” Luz
greeted, resting her arm against the doorframe.</p>
<p>“I need your help,” the illusionist explained.</p>
<p>Luz raised an eyebrow before stepping aside. “Alright, come on
in.”</p>
<p>As Gus took a seat on the couch, Luz wanted to learn more about the
situation at hand. “So, what do you need my help with?”</p>
<p>“You know how I’m the president of the Human Appreciation Society at
Hexside?” Gus began. Luz nodded in affirmation. “Well, today we had a
new member show up, Mattholomule, and everything was normal until he
started doubting the authenticity of my Human Realm artifacts. And then,
he dumped his own ‘artifacts’ on the table and said that people at his
old school were able to touch them all they wanted, which goes against
rule number one of the H.A.S. Obviously, I couldn’t let this stand, so I
said that I would get a genuine human to come in and verify the
authenticity of both of our artifacts to see which were real.”</p>
<p>Luz blinked a few times while her brain caught up to what she just
heard. “So, let me get this straight. A new guy shows up, calls your
artifacts fakes, and then pulls out his own artifacts and lets people
get all handsy with ‘em, so you say you’re gonna have a human come in
and say whether they are real or not?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that about sums it up,” Gus said cheerfully. “So, can you come
with me to the H.A.S. meeting and prove Mattholomule wrong?”</p>
<p>“Totally!” Luz responded without a second thought. But then that
second thought reared its head. “Though, if I want to not out myself as
a basilisk, I’ll have to come in disguise as another human.”</p>
<p>“Why’s that?” Gus asked.</p>
<p>“Well, think about it,” Luz said. “If I come in looking like myself,
then when I start going to Hexside, I’d have to do it as human-me, not
witch ears-me, and I really don’t want to be the center of attention for
having round ears. But if the human you bring in looks nothing like
witch ears-me, then I can attend Hexside as a normal student.”</p>
<p>Gus nodded. “Hmm, that is a good point. Though, how will you cover up
your lack of a bile sac when you enroll as a student?”</p>
<p>“I could just say I’m a magic-less witch,” Luz supplied. “Those
exist, right?”</p>
<p>“A witch can be born with a deformed or missing bile sac, yeah, but
it’s extremely rare,” Gus answered.</p>
<p>“Then that means I’ve got a cover story for enrolling,” Luz said,
before clapping her hands together and cracking her knuckles. “Alright,
Operation Prove-Mattholomule-Wrong is a go.”</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Luz, or rather, “Alex Zura”, examined herself in the mirror, turning
every which way to see her disguise in all its glory. What used to be a
dark brown pixie cut was now a chaotic mess of red and orange, falling
just past her shoulders. Her eyebrows had thickened, while her nose had
become more pointed. Her eyes, usually brown, were now a vibrant green.
A leather jacket (which Luz would never wear normally in this type of
weather) and an orange undershirt were complemented by a yellow pleated
skirt and a pair of black boots. All in all, nobody would be able to
confuse “Alex” and Luz.</p>
<p>After firing a pair of finger guns at the mirror and giving a smirk
to an imaginary camera, Luz ran down the stairs to show Gus her
disguise.</p>
<p>“Hey, Gus! How do I look?” Luz asked, entering the living room.</p>
<p>The illusionist gasped and chuckled. “Woah, that looks great!”</p>
<p>“Oh, stop it,” Luz said sarcastically, brushing the compliment off
with a hand wave. “So, you ready to laugh in Mattholomule’s face once we
debunk his phony artifacts?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t go that far, but yeah I’m ready,” Gus replied.</p>
<p>“Alrighty then. Let’s get this show on the road!” Luz replied
enthusiastically, raising a fist to the sky and charging out the front
door.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Though Principal Bump knew that someone would come busting through
his office door unannounced at some point in the day (it was practically
guaranteed), he would have never expected it to be Augustus Porter and
some fiery-haired human at such an early hour in the morning. Before the
Porter child could even open his mouth to begin talking, though,
Hieronymous raised a finger to silence the young prodigy. Only after
taking a long sip of his apple blood and mentally preparing himself for
whatever chaos was undoubtedly going to occur did he allow Mr. Porter to
explain his sudden entrance with the unknown human.</p>
<p>“Principal Bump,” Augustus began.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Porter?” he answered.</p>
<p>“I was wondering If I could get my friend Alex here a visitor’s
badge. I want to give her a tour of Hexside and have her sit in on a
meeting of the Human Appreciation Society. She might also help verify
the authenticity of some artifacts,” Augustus explained.</p>
<p>Principal Bump mulled over whether he should allow Mr. Porter’s
friend access or not. Against his better judgement, Bump decided it
would be fine to allow the human entry into the halls of Hexside for the
day. Spinning up a spell circle, Bump summoned a visitor’s badge.</p>
<p>“What is your full name, Miss?” Bump asked the human.</p>
<p>She hesitated for a split-second before answering, “I’m Alex Zura,
sir. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”</p>
<p>Bump swore he recognized that voice, but he couldn’t quite place it.
Nevertheless, he filled out the badge. Handing it over to the human, she
pinned it on her jacket. Whether it was some human fashion to wear long
sleeves in sweltering heat, or if he was just behind the times, Bump
wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. Bump.” That was the moment it finally clicked, and
Bump realized who he was talking to.</p>
<p>“Now hold on just one second, Miss Noceda.” The human let out a groan
of frustration.</p>
<p>“Aww, come on! How did you find out? This looks nothing like me!” Luz
couldn’t believe her disguise had already been seen through so
quickly.</p>
<p>“Your voice,” Bump explained. “You kept it the same.”</p>
<p>Luz facepalmed. “I didn’t even think of that. Do I still get to keep
the badge, though?”</p>
<p>“I’m a witch of my word,” the principal replied, “so you may keep the
visitor’s badge. Though, please try to not cause massive damage to the
school again. I don’t think I can handle another meeting with the
Construction Coven just yet.”</p>
<p>“Awesome!” Luz said, giving a celebratory fist pump. “Thank you, Mr.
Bump.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go feed the Choosy
Hat.” With that final goodbye, Luz and Gus exited the principal’s office
and braved the halls of Hexside School of Magic and Demonics.</p>
<p>“Well, Miss Zura, are you ready for your firsty officially sanctioned
tour of Hexside?” Gus asked in an exaggerated manner.</p>
<p>“Of course I am, Mister Porter. I can’t wait to see all the wonders
this school has to offer.” Luz re[plied in a similarly overt-the-top
voice.</p>
<p>The two stood in silence for a few seconds before bursting into peals
of laughter.</p>
<h1 id="luz-breaks-detention">Luz Breaks Detention</h1>
<p><strong>Kriegstag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Peace and quiet was a rarity in the Owl House, but with King dozing
off on the couch and her daugh her apprentice off running around with
Goops at Hexside, Eda finally had some time to herself. Claiming the
kitchen table as her work station, the Owl Lady reached into her hair
and withdrew one of her purchases from last night: a large picture
frame. She then reached in again and brought out Luz’s shed, carefully
laying it out on the table. Flipping the frame over, Eda took the back
cover off and slid the stock photo out after turning the little tabs
holding it in place. Looking at the photo, she saw a witch laughing
happily with her two children. Eda stared at the picture a few seconds
too long before she crumpled it up and set it ablaze with a quick spell
circle.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, right. Like that’ll ever happen.</em> Luz was her
apprentice and King was her roommate, and that was all they would ever
be. But, then again, the basilisk had called her “Mamá” on multiple
occasions now, and she had practically raised King for the last 8 years
or so. Even though they were as close as could be, when Eda was doing
her potions apprenticeship and training with Ms. Sarrasri, Titan rest
her soul, she had never once slipped up and called “Mom”. As for King,
well, Eda was pretty sure that there weren’t many 8 year olds living
with a 43 year old unless they were… family. Whether she liked it or
not, Eda had to admit that she cared deeply about both of those
kids.</p>
<p><em>Titan, this is all so confusing.</em> The Owl Lady let out a
groan and buried her face in her hands.</p>
<p>After a few seconds of silence, Eda recomposed herself up and focused
back on the task at hand. She first smoothed the skin as best she could,
gently squeezing out the folds and wrinkles until it all laid flat on
the table. She then laid the skin over the picture frame. The frame
itself was smaller than the skin, so there would need to be some folding
for it all to fit. Once the skin was neatly folded and completely inside
the frame, Eda replaced the back panel of the frame and turned the
notches so that it would all stay put.</p>
<p>Luz was going to love this.</p>
<p>Eda grabbed the picture frame and carried it into the living room.
Where should she hang it? After some careful deliberation (read: finding
the only place where the frame would fit), she decided that the best
spot for it was right next to her own framed wanted poster. After
roughly jamming a nail into the wall, she balanced the frame on the nail
so that the shed was perfectly upright.</p>
<p>As Eda looked at her apprentice’s molten skin hanging on the wall,
though, she came to a realization. While the Owl Lady was all that and
then some when it came to being the most powerful witch on the Boiling
Isles, she knew diddly squat about actually teaching the finer points of
spell-casting and magic in general.</p>
<p>Letting out a begrudging sigh, Edalyn Clawthorne finally accepted
that it was time to enroll her daughter/student at Hexside School of
Magic and Demonics.</p>
<p>As Gus showed Luz around campus, the basilisk couldn’t help but
notice the strange figures patrolling the hall. Every so often, she
would see them dragging students off to some unknown location with a
hook. Finally, as the two sat down for lunch, her curiosity got the best
of her and she needed to know what was going on.</p>
<p>“Hey, Gus?” Luz asked between bites of her sandwich. She was still
was getting used to the new raspier voice that came out of her
mouth.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Alex?” Gus was adamant about keeping Luz’s cover, so he never
referred to her by her actual name.</p>
<p>“What’s with the weird eyeless guys who keep smelling students?” One
of said weird figures had gotten awfully close to Luz when she and Gus
were heading to the cafeteria.</p>
<p>“Oh, those are just the trouble guards, don’t mind them,” Gus
explained. “Bump always brings them in when the Emperor’s Coven is going
to inspect the school soon. He’s usually pretty lax with the rules, and
he’ll let stuff slide if it isn’t too serious. Like, yeah, if you try
and fight someone you’ll get in trouble, but if your uniform isn’t
following dress code or whatever, he’ll typically turn a blind eye.”</p>
<p>“So, Bump brings these guys in to crack down on fights and stuff?”
Luz wished Gravesfield High was like that. The teachers and the singular
resource officer they staffed were apparently blind when it came to a
student being in distress.</p>
<p>“Pretty much. Fights, rule breaking, stuff like that,” Gus
replied.</p>
<p>Another question popped into Luz’s head. “Wait, would they be…
activated, or whatever, if <em>I</em> broke a rule? Like, I’m not a
student.”</p>
<p>“Eh, I’d rather not find out,” Gus responded.</p>
<p>“That’s probably a good idea,” Luz agreed.</p>
<p>The next few minutes of their lunch were of peaceful silence, until a
new voice grated against Luz’s eardrums.</p>
<p>“Hello, Augustus,” Mattholomule introduced himself, practically
slamming his lunch tray down onto the table.</p>
<p>“Hi, Matt,” Gus replied, not even bothering to turn his head and look
the new arrival in the eye.</p>
<p>“So, this is the ‘human’ you’re bringing in to verify my 100% genuine
artifacts?” Matt looked Luz up and down with a smirk on his face.</p>
<p>“Yes. Her name is Alex, and she has very kindly –” Gus began.</p>
<p>“The illusion isn’t even that good,” Matt interrupted. “You know, for
being a so-called expert, you got a lot of things wrong. For starters,
human hair doesn’t come in that color, and the irises are far too
bright. Oh, and don’t even get me started on that outfit.”</p>
<p>Luz took a deep breath and calmed herself down. Man, she wanted to
punch this kid in the face so hard. Nobody talks bad about her
friends.</p>
<p>“Oh my god, do you ever shut up?” she asked rhetorically. This kid
obviously loved hearing the sound of his own voice.</p>
<p>Matt gasped. “So the illusion can speak. Well, at least you got one
thing right, Augustus.”</p>
<p>“<em>Gus</em>,” she said, emphasizing her friend's preferred name,
“is an awesome illusionist, and he didn’t do anything wrong. Do you want
to know why? Because I’m not an illusion! I’m a human!”</p>
<p>“You sure don’t look like one,” Matt responded flatly.</p>
<p>Under the table, Luz balled her fists, clenching and unclenching them
so they weren’t being planted in this bozo’s face. “It’s called hair dye
and contact lenses, ever heard of ‘em? God forbid I want to express
myself.”</p>
<p>“Still doesn’t explain the ears. You could just be some random witch
Augustus paid off to pose as a human. Those round ears could just be an
illusion. I’m not convinced.” Matt crossed his arms in defiance.</p>
<p>Luz slowly exhaled. <em>I will not punch this kid in the face. I will
not punch this kid in the face. I will NOT punch this kid in the
face.</em> “Alright, that’s fine,” she said, forcing a smile and putting
on a faux cheery voice. “You can go on believing whatever lie you’re
telling yourself. When I prove your artifacts are junk, maybe you’ll
think otherwise, though.”</p>
<p>With a grunt, Matt picked up his lunch tray and went to go sit at
another table, leaving Gus and Luz to eat their lunch in peace. Pushing
her own tray over to the side, Luz folded her arms on the table and
rested her chin on her forearms.</p>
<p>“Sorry about that,” Luz apologized. “I think I went a little
overboard. I just <em>really</em> hate bullies.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be sorry,” Gus said. “We’ll all feel better once we show up to
the meeting and prove Matt wrong in front of everybody.”</p>
<p>For the second time that day, someone came barging into Principal
Bump’s office. Though he initally assumed it was going to be Miss
Noceda, it was actually her mentor that came through his doors
unannounced. Without even saying a word, Edalyn flipped the chair in
front of her around and then straddled it, crossing her arms over the
back of the chair and looking Bump in the face.</p>
<p>“Let me talk to ya, Bumpykins,” she started.</p>
<p>“Don’t call me that,” the principal replied instinctively. “Also, why
are you even here?”</p>
<p>Edalyn grabbed his nameplate and began tossing it from hand to hand.
“What, no chit chat?”</p>
<p>“I’d rather not, thank you. I am quite busy today,” Bump explained.
Spinning a quick spell circle, he righted the chair and returned his
nameplate back to his desk.</p>
<p>“Psh, you’re no fun,” the Owl Lady responded after she had flipped
back around to face the principal. She took a deep breath and blew a
strand of hair out of her face before continuing. “I’m here to enroll
my… apprentice Luz at Hexside. Now, before you start acting all
defensive –”</p>
<p>“Took you long enough,” Bump interrupted.</p>
<p>“You son of a – Wait, what?” Edalyn was shocked that the principal
had apparently been waiting for this to happen.</p>
<p>Bump rose from his seat and walked over to a file cabinet, unlocking
it and pulling out a stack of files. “I’ve seen how Miss Noceda acts
with members of our student body,” he said. “She would fit in perfectly
as a student here. You know, if you didn’t barge in just now, I would
have most likely offered Miss Noceda a spot here by the end of the day
regardless.”</p>
<p>“Hold up, really?” The Owl Lady had a look of amazement on her
face.</p>
<p>“Yes, really,” Bump replied as he returned to his seat. He then
slammed the files down on his desk. “Though, since you’re here, I have
something I’ll need you to do first before I consider handing over the
application.”</p>
<p>Eda stared at the files. She recognized each and every one of them.
Though, she couldn’t help but feel that something was off.</p>
<p>“Huh, I thought there’d be more,” she said with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Thank you all for coming on such short notice to this emergency
meeting,” Gus began. “Given this morning’s, ehem, ‘incident’, I’ve
pulled a few strings and I would like to introduce you to…”</p>
<p>“Alex” sprinted into the room and started running laps around the HAS
members, the theme from <em>Ricky</em> blaring from her phone, which she
held aloft like a torch.</p>
<p>“Alex Zura, a real human!” Gus finished.</p>
<p>“Alex” paused the song and stopped to catch her breath. Man, she
thought that running for her life on the daily would give her better
cardio, but, alas, that was not the case. She held up a finger, taking
in deep breaths. Once she had fully recouped her energy, she introduced
herself to the club members.</p>
<p>“Hey, everyone! I’m Alex, and Gus here has brought me in to help
verify the authenticity of some artifacts. Is that right?” She turned to
Gus to make sure everything was going to plan, to which he slightly
nodded.</p>
<p>“That’s right, Alex,” Gus confirmed. “We don’t want to waste any more
of your time, as I know you have a very busy schedule, so would you be
willing to start doing the verification now?”</p>
<p>“I would love to, Mr. Porter.” “Alex” moved to approach the table,
which contained both artifacts brought forth by Gus and by Matt. Luz
could instantly tell that the “artifacts” that Matt had provided were a
bunch of fakes. It was nearly comical how phony they looked. She had to
ham it up for the crowd, though, so “Alex” first examined one of Gus’
artifacts.</p>
<p>Picking up an empty bag of potato chips (which had been mistakenly
labelled as a “pillow case”), “Alex” scrutinized the bag, looking at it
from every which angle, sniffing the contents, and even wiping a speck
of salt from the bottom of the bag and tasting it.</p>
<p>“After a cursory analysis, I have confirmed that this article did,
indeed, come from my realm,” she proclaimed.</p>
<p>“Score 1 for Augustus!” Bo shouted. Gus gave a fist pump in
celebration, and Matt let out a small growl that Gus’ objects were
actually real.</p>
<p>Moving to the next artifact on the table, “Alex” picked up a “gulf
ball” and looked it over. Luz had to admit that this one at least was
somewhat correct. It was a roughly spherical rock that had been painted
white and had a few small holes drilled into it. If she was being
completely honest, this looked like something she could find in the
garbage.</p>
<p>“Hmm… This artifact is significantly harder, as it lacks any
distinctive Human realm-only features,” she began. “As such, I can not
rightly state whether this is from the Human Realm or not.”</p>
<p>“That’s snorse dung you [CENSORED]!” Matt shouted, rising to his feet
and pointing a finger at “Alex”. “That is a real human artifact! Titan,
are you even an actual human? Go ahead, Augustus, drop her illusion.
Show us who she really is!”</p>
<p>“You want me to show who I really am? Fine. How’s this?” Luz didn’t
care about keepig up the act anymore. She was pissed at this kid. All at
once, the years of bullying and torment that she had went through came
flooding back to her. Every snide comment, every backhanded insult,
every little quip. They all came back. “<em>Esto es una roca, idiota. Te
han estafado. No es una 'pelota de gulf'. Esa ni siquiera es la palabra
correcta. El deporte es 'golf', con una ‘o’!</em>” [“This is a rock, you
idiot. You’ve been scammed. It isn’t a 'gulf ball'. That's not even the
right word. The sport is 'golf', with an ‘o’!”] As she finished her
rant, Luz cocked her arm back and threw the rock as hard as she could at
the room’s window. The glass instantly shattered, and the “gulf ball”
sailed through the air before rolling to a stop a solid twenty paces
away.</p>
<p>The room was silent, save for Luz’s heavy breathing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the trouble guards burst into the room, grabbing both Luz
and Matt in their hooks before dragging them away. As the two
troublemakers were being sent off to the detention pit, Matt kept trying
to plead innocence. His pleading wasn’t working well though.</p>
<p>“Let me go, you [CENSORED]! I didn’t do anything wrong! It’s all
Augustus’ and that [CENSORED] fault! He should be the one going to the
detention pit, not me! Hey! Are you even listening to me,
[CENSORED]-for-brains?”</p>
<p>Needless to say, if Matt didn’t have a one-way trip to the detention
pit then, he sure did now.</p>
<p>Eda groaned as she wheeled over the mop and bucket. Bump now had her
cleaning off all the hexed graffiti she’d tagged the lockers with over
the years. While they were some of the finest works of her younger
years, she hated to see all that effort get washed away.</p>
<p><em>This is for Luz. I’m doing this all for Luz. It’ll be worth it
when this is all over.</em> The Owl Lady repeated that mantra over and
over in her head as she made up for all the chaos she had caused.</p>
<p>As the door to the detention pit slammed shut, Matt instantly tried
prying it back open for an easy escape. The door didn’t budge. After
kicking the door in frustration, Matt let out another string of curses
before slumping to the ground in defeat.</p>
<p>“Do you kiss your momma with that mouth?” Luz asked sarcastically.
While Luz wasn’t quite sure what they meant, Eda was particularly fond
of dropping some very spicy Boiling Isles swear words when something
went wrong with a potion, and it looks like Matt had a similar potty
mouth.</p>
<p>“Buzz off,” the Construction track witch replied. Ignoring the
command, Luz walked over to stand in front of Matt and offered him a
hand up, but he didn’t take it, leaving her hanging.</p>
<p>After the rejection, Luz crossed her arms and looked down at the
witch. “Look, man. I’m just trying to help you out, okay? We’re both in
detention, and that sucks. Can we at least work together so we can get
out of here in one piece?” She offered her hand once again.</p>
<p>Matt stared at the offered help up before exhaling sharply. “Fine,
but I take the lead.” He pulled himself to his feet, looking annoyed the
whole time at the prospect of getting help from someone posing as a
human.</p>
<p>A rumble shook the entire detention pit as the ground in front of the
two began to separate, revealing a massive hole lined with a fleshy pink
material and row upon row of eyes and teeth. Deep into the pit, Luz
could see various students, all trapped in weird blue cocoons made out
of an odd jelly.</p>
<p>“Starting already? Wow, they don’t mess around here,” Matt said. He
then turned to Luz and added, “Now would be a really good time to drop
your disguise.”</p>
<p>The basilisk laughed. She couldn’t believe it. “You’re still telling
yourself that? Newsflash, buddy, I don’t have a disguise to drop. I
don’t have pointy ears. I can’t cast magic spells by drawing a circle
with my finger. I. Am. A. HUMAN!”</p>
<p>Matt froze. “Wait, really?”</p>
<p>“YES!” Luz screamed in frustration.</p>
<p>All the witch could respond with was a short “Huh.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a giant snake creature with a human-like face reared up
from the pit. The face itself was a sickly gray color, but the body of
the snake thing was olive green and had rings of black going down the
length it.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, the <em>Gehirnwäscheschlangen</em>. Forgot about those,”
Matt said as if nothing was out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, the what?” Luz had no idea what the witch had just
said.</p>
<p>The creature opened its mouth, and a long, slimy tongue shot out,
wrapping around Matt’s ankle before dragging him down to the bottom of
the pit at a speed which Luz could barely even comprehend.</p>
<p>“Oh my god, Matt!” Luz shouted. Another one of the snake monsters
rose from the pit and turned to face Luz, but before it could trap her
as well, she punched it on the snout, causing it to retreat. Cursing her
mother for instilling such good values in her, Luz jumped into the pit
after Matt.</p>
<p>Bouncing off a stray eyeball and landing on her feet, Luz looked for
the pod that held Matt. As it floated by over head, she quickly tore it
down and set it on the ground. She needed to get him out of this
thing.</p>
<p><em><strong>YOU WILL BE A GOOD STUDENT</strong></em>, a disembodied
voice said.</p>
<p>“I will be a good student,” Matt repeated.</p>
<p>Letting out a growl, Luz tried to rip the pod open with her bare
hands, but she couldn’t find purchase. She needed something sharp, and
Luz knew just the morph for the job. Quickly shapeshifting into the
Kraugh, she used her wrist blade to slice open Matt’s pod. Draping the
boy over her shoulder, she was surprised at how light he was. She felt
like he barely weighed more than a duck! Or maybe she was just strong.
That was probably it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Luz began quickly scaling the walls of the detention
pit, using her wrist blades like pitons, slamming them into the side of
the pit as she ascended. As a bonus, each time she drove a wrist blade
into the pit, the <em>Gehirnwäscheschlangen</em> would slink away,
further and further from the giant bladed monster the higher she
climbed. Once she reached the top of the pit, she dragged herself over
the edge and clambered to her feet. She took a few deep breaths. Man,
that climb had taken a lot out of her.</p>
<p>There was no way she was going to stay trapped in this room, so she
had to find a way to bust down that door. The Kraugh, while good for
fighting off the brain-washing snake things and climbing and such,
wasn’t exactly built for causing massive property damage. Running
through a list of animals in her mind, Luz eventually settled on one:
the rhinoceros. Though she was tired, Luz powered through it and
eventually finished the morph, though it was a slow process. Adjusting
Matt so that he was on her back, Luz backed up a few paces before
charging, full speed, at the door to the outside world.</p>
<p>The door flew off its hinges as Luz barreled through. Now that the
two of them were free, Luz finally laid down. As she did so, her body
decided that it was time to take a quick nap. As Matt rolled off her
back and faceplanted on the tiled floor, Luz blissfully entered the
realm of Sunshine Sleepy Fun Time.</p>
<p>“Edalyn?”</p>
<p>“What is it now, Bumperoni?”</p>
<p>“Would you care to explain why there is an unconscious student next
to an obese gray unicorn just outside the detention pit with the door
broken on the other side of the hallway?”</p>
<p>Steve rapped three times on the door to Matt’s bedroom. He had taken
his annual day off today so he could surprise his younger brother with a
visit. Ma had said on a CB call that Matty was finally switching over to
Hexside, and that today was his first day. Steve would be a fool if he
was gonna miss that.</p>
<p>“Go away, I don’t wanna talk,” came Matt’s voice from the other side
of the door.</p>
<p><em>Well, that doesn’t sound right,</em> Steve thought. What could
have Matty in such a bad mood?</p>
<p>Steve waited a few seconds to let the tension build before replying.
“Really? Not even to me?”</p>
<p>Steve heard a loud <em>THUMP</em>, presumably from Matty falling out
of bed, followed by the sound of his younger sibling running to open the
door. The coven scout chuckled at his sibling’s enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Hey, dude,” Steve greeted casually with a wave, as if nothing was
out of the ordinary and this wasn’t the first time he’d seen Matty
in-person in over a year.</p>
<p>Matt quickly wrapped his older brother up in a hug. “Steve!”</p>
<p>Steve laughed, reciprocating the embrace. “That’s my name, so don’t
wear it out!”</p>
<p>Breaking off the hug, Matt had a million questions. “How… how are you
here? <em>Why</em> are you here? Did you sneak out of Emperor Belos’
castle? Are you gonna get in trouble?”</p>
<p>“Relax, Matt. I just took my day off,” Steve explained.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Matt realized that that made a lot more sense than Steve
sneaking out of the castle.</p>
<p>“So, how’ve ya been? How’d your first day at Hexside go? Did anyone
beat my record for most healing ward visits yet?” Steve replied, asking
his own volley of questions.</p>
<p>Matt groaned. “Ugh, today was awful. You know how Hexside has a Human
Appreciation Society?”</p>
<p>Steve nodded. While he wasn’t as gung-ho about humans as Matty was,
he would always be willing to listen to his younger brother ramble on
about some human artifact he had found on the beach or had bought at the
market.</p>
<p>“Well, I attended their meeting today and wanted to show off all the
cool artifacts I’ve collected, but then Augustus got all hot and
bothered when I didn’t think his so-called ‘artifacts’ were the
real-deal. His stuff looked so fake! But then he brought in this human,
and she called all of my artifacts fakes, and then started talking in
this weird language, and we got thrown in detention, and –” Matt
rambled.</p>
<p>The coven scout held up a hand to stop Matt. “Hold on, there was a
human at Hexside? Tell me <em>everything</em>.”</p>
<h1 id="luz-catches-a-thermal">Luz Catches A Thermal</h1>
<p><strong>Schlimmtag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>As Luz plodded down the stairs and into the kitchen, she loosed a
massive yawn, alerting the Owl Lady and King to her presence. She was
dressed in an oversized t-shirt and a pair of <em>Good Witch
Azura</em>-branded pajama bottoms, and her tail hung limp behind her,
poking out from a hole in the back of her pants. Taking a seat at the
table, the basilisk let out a smaller yawn and stretched her arms out
wide, feeling her shoulders <em>POP</em> as she did so. <em>Ahh, that
feels better</em>, she thought. Turning to Eda, Luz started the morning
off with a question. “Got any big plans today?”</p>
<p>“I’m gonna take over the world!” King shouted gleefully, raising a
paw to the sky.</p>
<p>Luz chuckled at the remark and rubbed King’s skull, which was the
closest she could get to giving the tiny demon an affectionate noogie.
“Sure you are, buddy. You’re gonna be the best tyrannical overlord ever.
What about you, Eda?”</p>
<p>“Not much really,” the Owl Lady answered. “I’ve got some potions
brewing, but they won’t be done for a couple days, so today’s gonna be
nice ‘n relaxing. Hopefully.” Speaking of potions, she needed to take
hers. She didn’t want to find herself in a feathery situation if she
could help it. Opening a cabinet, she withdrew one of her elixirs.
Uncorking it, she forced down the bitter concoction, feeling the magic
work its, well, magic. That should keep Bird Brain from pestering her
for a while. After wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, Eda
placed the now-empty bottle back in the cabinet.</p>
<p>She then clapped her hands together to get the other two’s attention.
“Alright, breakfast. What are we thinking?”</p>
<p>In response, Luz’s stomach growled loudly. “I’m fine with whatever,
but could I… um… have some magic, please? I did a lot of morphing
yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, sure thing. Here ya go, kid.” Eda then spun up a giant ball
of light and it floated over to Luz.</p>
<p>The basilisk gleefully drained it. “Thanks, Eda,” she said with a
smile, feeling her stomach nearly fill to the brim with all that
magic.</p>
<p>“Eh, no worries,” Eda responded. “So, back to the task at hand: food.
What do you want, King?”</p>
<p>The demon in question thought about his options before answering.
“Can we make some more of that sancocho stuff? It was really good!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’re not doing that,” the Owl Lady replied, shutting down the
plan instantly.</p>
<p>“Plus, sancocho is more of a lunch or dinner meal,” Luz added. “It’s
not exactly breakfast material.”</p>
<p>King let out a huff before offering up another meal idea. “How about
griffin eggs and toast, instead?”</p>
<p>Eda smiled. “Now you’re talking my language.”</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>Luz hummed a little ditty to herself as she scraped everyone’s plates
free of crumbs and leftovers, offering the tiny morsels up to whatever
demon resided in their trash can. What demon it was exactly, she did not
know. Maybe it was Hooty? That made some sort of sense. He <em>was</em>
the house, after all…</p>
<p>Saving that thought for a later date, Luz was impressed with how the
meal had turned out. Eda sure knew her way around the kitchen, as
evidenced by her ability to make even the most mundane meals taste
great. The eggs had been perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the
bloodberry jelly that she’d added to the toast was not only scrumptious,
but it also gave her a little more magic to work with, which was a nice
bonus.</p>
<p>Depositing the dirty plates in the sink, Luz turned to head up to her
room to relax, but the Owl Lady stopped her. “Hold on one second, kid.
I’ve got something I want to show you.” Not waiting for the girl’s
reply, Eda turned and walked into the living room. Shrugging her
shoulders, Luz followed after, wondering what surprise the witch had up
her sleeve.</p>
<p>Coming to a stop in the middle of the living room, Eda turned to Luz.
“Notice anything different?” The basilisk looked around the room, trying
to spot what might have changed. The giant wanted poster looked like it
hadn’t been touched, and she couldn’t find anything wrong with any of
the random memorabilia hanging from the walls. The giant sword was still
there. That one pineapple grenade was still precariously hanging from
its pin. What could’ve been changed?</p>
<p>Then Luz saw it.</p>
<p>Hanging right next to Eda’s wanted poster was a picture frame, and
inside that frame was something that Luz had almost forgotten about.</p>
<p>“My shed!” Luz exclaimed. “You kept it!” She wrapped the Owl Lady up
in a bone crushing hug. “Thank you, thank you, thank you! I love
it!”</p>
<p>Eda chuckled as Luz slowly disengaged from the embrace. “That’s not
the only thing I wanted to show you, though. You know how you were
running around with Goops at Hexside yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that was a blast!” Luz replied eagerly, before she remembered
how the visit had ended. “Except for the whole getting thrown in
detention thing. That kinda sucked.”</p>
<p>“Well, how would you like to see Goops and Plant Girl every day?” Eda
asked.</p>
<p>“I mean, that would be totally awesome, but I’m not a student at
Hexside,” Luz responded.</p>
<p>“Yeah, about that…” Eda reached into her hair and pulled out the
enrollment papers that Bump had given her. “I had Bumpypoo pull some
strings, and you’ll be starting next week at Hexside School of Magic and
Demonics. That is, if you want to go. This is completely up to you.” The
Owl Lady made sure to emphasize that last part. While Hexside hadn’t
exactly been Eda’s cup of tea back in the day (Thanks a lot, Fausty, you
old fart.), she knew that Luz would love it there. The whole “Friendship
and camaraderie is the <em>real</em> magic!” schtick they had was right
up the basilisk’s alley.</p>
<p>Luz couldn’t believe what she was hearing. She was actually going to
be attending Hexside! She had thought that it was just some pipe dream,
but the papers Eda held in her hand said otherwise. Luz slowly reached
her hand out, and the Owl Lady handed over the papers so that Luz could
look them over to make sure they were real and that she wasn’t imagining
everything.</p>

<p>“Had to make some assumptions ‘bout your birthday, so I just put the
day you and I first met, if that’s fine by you. You are 14, right?” Eda
explained.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I am, and that’s fine,” Luz replied. “So, we’re going with the
‘I don’t have a working bile sac’ cover story so I can attend as a
witch?”</p>
<p>“Yup. I heard you and Goops talking about that, so I ran the idea by
Bump, and he gave it the okay,” Eda said.</p>
<p>Luz wrapped Eda up in another hug. “Thank you, Eda,” she
whispered.</p>
<p>Eda reciprocated the gesture, giving her apprentice/daughter a
squeeze. “No worries, kid.”</p>
<p>A sudden knock at the door drew the attention of Eda and Luz. The
basilisk was the first to move, going over to open the door and
revealing Willow and Gus standing in the doorway. Motioning for them to
come inside, she greeted them. “Hey, Gus. Hi, Willow.” The two students
weren’t in their normal uniforms, instead being decked out with Hexside
branded merchandise. Willow had on a yellow and blue jersey with the
school logo on it and a ballcap, while Gus was wearing a similarly
colored sweater.</p>
<p>“Hi, Luz, Miss Eda,” Gus said as he stepped into the Owl House. He
then noticed the papers Luz held in her hand. “Ooh, what’s that?”</p>
<p>Quickly hiding the papers behind her back, Luz gave a cheeky smile.
“Guess.”</p>
<p>“Is it… your tax return?” Willow asked, unsure of her answer, which
drew a laugh from the basilisk.</p>
<p>“Not even close. Good try though,” she turned to the illusionist.
“What do you think it is, Gus?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Gus tapped a finger against his chin. “Is it a wanted
poster?”</p>
<p>“No, but that <em>would</em> be really cool.” Luz held the papers
back out in front of her. “This is my application to Hexside. I’m going
to be starting next week!”</p>
<p>“No way! That’s awesome!” Gus could barely hide his excitement at the
prospect of Luz attending Hexside.</p>
<p>“Woah, really? What track are you going to join?” Willow asked.</p>
<p>The question caught Luz off guard. She hadn’t actually thought about
what track she would end up joining. They all seemed so cool! She would
pick all of them if she could, but it looked like she was limited to a
single option. Her top three would have to be Beast Keeping, Healing,
and Potions. Beast Keeping was a pretty obvious choice, given that she
was technically a beast demon. (The fact that the Beast Keeping coven
head was also an absolute cutey-patootie totally did not factor into
that decision.) Healing also made sense, mainly due to the fact that Luz
had practically shadowed her mom at work, and those skills she had
picked up probably translated over pretty nicely. Finally, Potions would
probably go well since Eda was practically a genius when it came to
whipping up any kind of elixir or brew and she could help Luz out
whenever she ran into a spot of trouble with her schoolwork.</p>
<p>“I’d join all of them if I could, but I would say Beast Keeping as my
first pick,” Luz finally said after deliberating for a few seconds.</p>
<p>“Ooh, I’ve heard good things from students in that track,” Willow
said. “Plant track and Beast Keeping track share a few classes and they
say it’s really fun!”</p>
<p>“That’s nice,” Luz responded, before switching the topic. “So, uhh…
why are you guys here exactly? Shouldn’t you be in class?”</p>
<p>“There’s no classes today,” Gus explained.</p>
<p>“Really? Why’s that?” Luz had to admit she was a little confused.</p>
<p>“It’s the Second Schlimmtag of the Sixth Lunar Disappearance,” Willow
said, as if that was supposed to explain why they weren’t at
Hexside.</p>
<p>Luz simply blinked. What did today’s date have to do with
anything?</p>
<p>“Y’know, the traditional date for the annual Grudgby match between
Hexside and Glandus?” Gus added.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s cool,” Luz replied.</p>
<p>“’Cool’?” Gus was astounded at the basilisk’s seeming indifference to
such an important match. “It’s only the most anticipated match of the
year between the two most storied teams of all the Isles! It’s way more
than just ‘cool’!”</p>
<p>“What Gus is trying to say is that we got you a ticket and would love
it if you came with us to the match,” Willow explained.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll definitely go!” Luz said, excited at the prospect of
seeing what the Isles had in terms of sports. She then remembered who
her acting guardian was and turned to the Owl Lady to ask for
permission. “Can I go to the game, Eda?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, of course,” the grey-haired witch replied. “I was actually the
star player for the Banshees back in the day. Nobody could stop us when
we were on top of our game.” She reached into her hair and pulled out a
folded-up photo, showing a much younger Owl Lady. The Eda in the picture
had bright orange hair and a cocky smile on her face, her neck draped
with numerous medals, a trophy held up in one hand.</p>
<p>Willow, Luz, and Gus crowded around the picture. The illusionist was
the first to comment. “Wow, that’s a lot of awards.”</p>
<p>“Well, I would love to regal you all with tales from my youth, but if
you want to catch the match, you’ll probably want to head out soon. In
the meantime, I’m taking a nap, so nobody disturb me. Mama needs her
beauty sleep.” Eda tucked the photo back in her hair and left, going up
to her room to catch some much-needed Zs.</p>
<p>“When does the game start?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>Gus looked down at his watch before answering. “45 minutes.”</p>
<p>“Wait, when does the bus leave, then?” Luz followed up with.</p>
<p>The question sparked Gus’ memory. “Oh crud, the bus! We need to go
now if we want to catch it!”</p>
<p>The two students and one soon-to-be student bolted in the direction
of Hexside, hoping they could make it in time to catch the
transportation.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>As the three finally made it to Hexside, they could see a winged
demon carrying all their fellow students off to the match. A banner
trailed behind the bus, identifying it as belonging to the Hexside
Banshees. The trio came to a stop, looking on as their schoolmates
slowly disappeared from view.</p>
<p>“Aww, dang it. I can’t believe we missed the bus!” Gus exclaimed.</p>
<p>“How are we going to get to Glandus now?” Willow asked. “Dad and Papa
are both working, so they can’t give us a ride.”</p>
<p>“So is my dad, and we can’t just steal Owlbert from Miss Eda,” Gus
added.</p>
<p>As that exchange was going on, Luz was busy thinking. She had no idea
if this plan was going to work, and she especially had no idea if she
had enough magic to pull this off, but it was worth a shot. “Hey, guys,
I’ve got an idea.”</p>
<p>Willow and Gus turned to face the basilisk. “What’s your idea?” the
plant witch asked.</p>
<p>“Well, we obviously can’t walk to Glandus, and we don’t have a
palisman at our disposal, so what if I just, like, morph a dragon or
something and fly us to the match,” Luz said, explaining the basics of
her plan.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you have enough magic to do that?” Gus questioned.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure,” Luz replied. “Eda gave me some of her magic
earlier, so I’m basically operating at 100% magic capacity.”</p>
<p>“I say it’s worth a shot,” Willow said, with Gus nodding in
agreement.</p>
<p>“Alright, then can you two step back?” Luz requested. “I need some
space to do this properly.” Willow and Gus abided, moving back to give
Luz about a ten-foot radius.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Luz said, before closing her eyes and focusing on the morph
she was about to do. For what felt like the billionth time, Luz was
thankful for being a bookworm. She was basing this morph off an old
novel from the 90s she had read a few years back, called <em>Dragon
Master</em>. For a kid’s book, it had gone into a surprising amount of
detail about how a dragon’s body worked, and Luz was now eternally
grateful to the author of that book.</p>
<p>The first change that took place was her back, where two sets of
bones erupted from her spine before splaying out to their full size.
Thankfully, the bones didn’t stay naked for long, as red, leathery skin
soon spread across the bones, eventually taking shape into a pair of
wings. While it would be cool to look like a witch with a tail and
wings, Luz needed to keep the morph going. She couldn’t exactly carry
her friends in her arms all the way to Glandus.</p>
<p>The next stage of the morph focused on her head and neck. Her mouth
and nose slowly grew closer together, all the while elongating to form a
snout. Her nose eventually flattened into the snout, leaving just two
nostrils. Her neck elongated as well, making it look like someone had
stretched Luz’s neck like a putty. Then, her skin began to change, going
from smooth to scaley, growing redder until it eventually matched the
tone of her wings. Her eyes spread apart, moving to the sides of her
head, much like they did when she morphed into a horse, giving her a
much wider field of vision. Her ears also moved, sliding further back
and growing longer and pointier. To top it all off, a pair of horns
sprouted from her head. Did they serve any real purpose? No. Did they
look cool as heck? Totally.</p>
<p>Then, her arms and legs changed. Her fingers and toes shifted from
stubby, round digits to sharp claws as Luz fell to all fours, not being
able to stand upright anymore. Scales emanated from her shoulders and
hips, eventually moving to cover her entire body, save for her tail,
which still had the basilisk-type scales. Finally, her tail elongated,
dragon scales spreading from base to tip and a few tiny spikes
protruding from the tip, giving Luz a makeshift mace. With that last
change, her morph was complete.</p>
<p>Taking a few test steps, Luz inched closer to Willow and Gus. Given
that she couldn’t effectively talk right now, she instead gave a toothy
smile and attempted to flash a thumbs up, hoping to get across the
message that she was a-okay and ready to take flight. Once she figured
out how to fly, that is. She hadn’t really thought about that part when
she came up with the plan. Hopefully it was just pointing in a direction
and flapping your wings.</p>
<p>“Are you still in there, Luz?” Willow asked, to which the dragon
nodded. Luz repositioned herself and got down on her belly, allowing the
two witches easier access to hop up onto her back.</p>
<p>“This is gonna be awesome!” Gus shouted, quickly clambering up onto
Luz and getting comfy. Willow followed suit, but she had a little bit of
trouble getting her footing before she eventually made it onto her
friend’s back, placing herself between Luz’s wings.</p>
<p>Now that both her buddies were in position, Luz scratched at the
ground three times to get their attention. “You ready, Luz?” Gus asked,
to which she nodded again.</p>
<p>Slowly backing until her tail was brushing up against the stairs of
the school, Luz gave herself a runway for takeoff. Scratching the ground
twice to ready the others, Luz waited a few seconds before taking off,
running as fast as she could before reaching the tree line. Just before
she crashed into the forest, though, she squatted down and leapt with
all the strength she could muster and flapped her wings, sending the
trio up into the air.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>As Luz flew to Glandus, Willow and Gus would occasionally give
directions so that the dragon didn’t end up going the wrong way. Flying
was actually a lot easier than she thought it would be. It wasn’t tons
of constant flapping like she expected but was more of just making small
adjustments with her wings to keep herself on course as the air flowed
over her wings while she glided. Every so often, she would hit a big
bubble of warm air that would lift her up, rising under her wings as she
floated higher. Eventually, Luz caught sight of a giant building jutting
out of the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>“That’s Glandus!” Willow announced. Luz looked for a safe place to
land out of sight of anyone else, settling on a clearing just outside
the school grounds. Making more small adjustments to how her wings were
oriented, Luz slowly glided down, circling around the clearing until the
group finally touched down.</p>
<p>Gus was the first to hop off, a huge smile on his face. “That was so
cool! We have to do that again some time.”</p>
<p>Willow slowly dismounted, voicing her agreement as she did so. “Yeah,
that was way more fun than I thought it would be.”</p>
<p>As Luz quickly demorphed back into her witch-ears form (sans tail,
sadly), she copied Gus’ smile. “That was an absolute blast!”</p>
<p>Checking his watch once again, Gus let the others know how much time
they had. “The match starts in 10 minutes. If we hurry, we should be
able to find some seats.”</p>
<p>Willow turned to Luz. “So, are you ready to experience your first
Grudgby game?”</p>
<p>In response, Luz morphed herself into her own set of Hexside
merchandise. “Let’s do it!”</p>
<h1 id="luz-experiences-her-first-grudgby-game">Luz Experiences Her
First Grudgby Game</h1>
<p><strong>Schlimmtag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Terror
Vortex Field at Glandus High</strong></p>
<p>As Luz settled down into her seat, she could barely contain her
energy, doing her best to make sure that her tail didn’t decide to make
a surprise appearance. Willow and Gus were similarly hyped for the
match, with Willow even starting a few call-and-response chants with
other Hexside students.</p>
<p>“1-oh, 2-oh, 3-oh, 4!” she would yell. While the plant witch did
this, Gus pulled out a pair of small blue flags and acted like he was
conducting an orchestra.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna run up the score!” they would respond.</p>
<p>“5-oh, 6-oh, 7-oh, 8!” she’d continue.</p>
<p>“Banshees, we’re gonna dominate!” they would scream, even louder than
before.</p>
<p>After the chant had been repeated a few times, Luz found herself
joining in, screaming at the top of her lungs about how they were going
to destroy Glandus. As Luz participated in the chant, she eventually
realized that she had no idea what the rules of Grudgby even were. Since
Willow was currently preoccupied with being a yell leader, she resorted
to seeing if Gus was willing to enlighten her on the game she was about
to watch.</p>
<p>“Psst, Gus.” He didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“Gus!” she tried again, louder this time. The boy turned to look at
Luz.</p>
<p>“Yeah?” he asked, still doing his little conductor movements with the
flags.</p>
<p>“What are the rules?” she asked. Gus pocketed his flags before
scooting over so he was closer to the basilisk.</p>
<p>“Ok, do you see that circle in the middle of the field?” Gus pointed,
and Luz followed with her eyes. There was, in fact, a painted white
circle about 10 feet in diameter smack dab in the center of the
field.</p>
<p>“Uh huh.” Luz nodded in the affirmative.</p>
<p>“That’s where the players start, and they all have to be touching the
circle for the game to begin. When everyone is ready, the grudgball is
launched into the air and the game is officially under way when someone
from either team catches it.” Gus spun up a small illusion depicting the
field with tiny players standing on the circle. An even tinier ball was
then shot out of the ground, and multiple players leapt up to grab
it.</p>
<p>“And what’s with those big pole things with the hoops?” Luz doubted
they were just there for decoration.</p>
<p>“Those are the goals. You have to get the grudgball to pass through
one of those to score for your team.” The illusion of a player then
threw the grudgball through the hoop on the opposite end of the field
and jumped for joy before disappearing as Gus dispelled the
illusion.</p>
<p>“I’m guessing whoever has the most points at the end wins?” Luz
wanted to make sure that there wasn’t some super convoluted rule that
would eliminate all the work that a team might do over the course of a
game.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s how you would win a game. However, since Grudgby is so
fast paced because of the 10-minute time limit, you typically see teams
play a best of 5 series, which is what we’re doing today. That’s only
how a typical game goes though,” Gus responded, (Luz sensed there was a
“but“ coming.) “but sometimes a game will be played under Smidge rules,
where you forego the points system and just see whoever can catch this
little guy first and whichever team does that wins.” Gus conjured up
another illusion, this time of a winged metal beetle covered in
rust.</p>
<p>Luz let out a sigh. “Of course, there’s an instant-win version of the
game, because why wouldn’t there be.”</p>
<p>Gus gave the basilisk a pat on the shoulder. “If it makes you feel
better, most people think that Smidge rules Grudgby is stupid and
defeats the purpose of the game.”</p>
<p>Luz laughed. “Well, I’m not disagreeing with that. So, the game is
basically just passing the grudgball around until someone throws it
through the hoop?”</p>
<p>Gus wavered his hand in a so-so motion. “Well, that and you have to
be wary of all the traps that are on the field. Though, everyone can use
their magic, so you also have to worry about your opponents attacking
you directly.”</p>
<p>At the mention of being able to use one’s own magic, Luz had an idea.
“Wait, does that mean that I could use my shapeshifting if I was
playing?”</p>
<p>Gus thought about it for a second before answering. “I mean, there’s
nothing saying you can’t do that, so I guess it would be legal.”</p>
<p>Luz smiled. “Ahh, the <em>Air Pal</em> argument. Got it.”</p>
<p>“What’s an ‘<em>Air Pal</em> argument’?” Gus asked.</p>
<p>Oh right, this was the Boiling Isles. “<em>Air Pal</em> is a movie
about a dog that plays basketball, and it’s allowed since there isn’t a
rule about dogs not being allowed to play basketball,” Luz
explained.</p>
<p>Gus nodded along like he understood, even though he really didn’t.
What was basketball, and why would a dog want to play it?</p>
<p>Suddenly, the crowd around them grew exponentially louder. Looking
for the cause of the uproar, Luz saw that the timer on the scoreboard
said that there was only 1 minute until the players took the field.
Seeing that everyone around her was on their feet (or other various
appendages, depending on the species), Luz copied them and rose from her
seat.</p>
<p>“Witches and demons, ARE YOU READY FOR SOME GRUDGBYYYYYYYYY?!” the
public announcer yelled, drawing a massive cheer from both sides. From
the tunnels on both sides of the stadium, four witches emerged, all of
whom were dressed in protective equipment so that they didn’t die after
stumbling on the very first trap.</p>
<p>“Introducing your home team. Dusty Everhart! Senna Wales! S’reee!
Captained by Loca, they are the Glandus High Gorgons!” The Glandus
student section erupted into cheers, a few of them even throwing purple
and white streamers onto the field. The four witches on the far side of
the field stepped up to the circle and took their places, evenly spacing
themselves out. Luz had to admit that they looked pretty fierce, most of
them sporting scowls. The illusion was broken, though, when Loca cracked
a joke, causing her teammates to smile for a split second before
resuming their death glares at the Banshees.</p>
<p>“And for the away team. Cat DeLisle! Skara Brooks! Amelia! Captained
by Boscha Riegel, they are the Hexside Banshees!” This time it was the
Hexside student section to erupt, throwing out their own streamers,
though these ones were blue and gold colored. As Boscha and her crew
took their places on the circle, Luz felt a twinge of indecision over
whether she should actually be cheering for the triclops given how she
treated Willow and Amity. Eventually, Luz decided that she would cheer
for everyone on Hexside’s team <em>except</em> for Boscha. That would
work for now.</p>
<p>As the players readied themselves on the starting circle, Luz waited
with bated breath as the timer on the scoreboard counted down. Even
though it was only 10 seconds, it felt like an eternity to the energetic
basilisk.</p>
<p>10…</p>
<p>Boscha adjusted her left kneepad, tightening the strap to make sure
it was secure.</p>
<p>9…</p>
<p>Skara wiped the sweat from her brow, flinging it aside.</p>
<p>8…</p>
<p>Cat rolled her shoulders and snuck in a quick calf stretch.</p>
<p>7…</p>
<p>Amelia cracked her knuckles and wrung her hands thrice.</p>
<p>6…</p>
<p>Loca reached into her pocket and took out a small bottle. Uncapping
the drink, she downed it in one go before tossing the bottle behind
her.</p>
<p>5…</p>
<p>Senna squatted down, slapping the ground with both hands before
throwing some dirt over her shoulder.</p>
<p>4…</p>
<p>Dusty took off her headband and turned it inside out before putting
it back on.</p>
<p>3…</p>
<p>S’reee closed her eyes and bowed her head, muttering something under
her breath.</p>
<p>2…</p>
<p>All 10 players prepared themselves, knees bent, ready to jump.</p>
<p>1…</p>
<p>The grudgball shot out of the ground, and the game was on.</p>
<p>Every player on the field leapt for the ball, hoping to gain the
first possession of the game. By the slimmest margin, Dusty was the
first to leave her feet, but the Banshees had prepared for this. Before
Dusty could even reach for the ball, Skara had already launched herself
into the other girl’s stomach, before the two of them slammed into the
dirt, effectively downing Dusty for the opening possession. (Luz sucked
in a sharp breath. <em>Oof, that had to hurt.</em>)</p>
<p>If the Gorgons did what the Banshees thought they were going to do,
then they would be aggressive and have Loca grab the ball and fight to
maintain control of it while she landed. They didn’t. As Loca reached
for the ball, instead of grabbing hold of the ball, she instead tapped
it behind her head, where S’reee was waiting patiently. Landing
gracefully with the ball now in her hands, S’reee took off running
toward the Hexside goalhoop. As the remaining members of the Banshees
landed, they realized that they’d been duped. Of course the Gorgons
would wait for their biggest rivalry game to do something so un-Gorgons
to start off.</p>
<p>As S’reee tore down field, she made the mistake of looking behind her
to see if anyone was tailing her. As her head was turned, she ran
straight into a wall of abomination goop that had shot up, forming a
massive wall. Bouncing off the sudden obstacle, she landed on her
backside, the ball flying out of her hands as her arms flew back to
catch her fall.</p>
<p>Boscha could have quickly scooped up the ball and ran with it, but
she couldn’t stop herself from gloating. Flicking the ball up and
catching it in both hands, she turned to her fallen opponent. “Rookie
mistake,” she said in a faux-cheery voice before laughing and sticking
her tongue out. Shifting the ball to be in a more defensive position,
she turned to advance in the other direction. Her possession of the
grudgball was short lived, though. Boscha only made it a few steps
before she was sent flying backwards from a blast of bard magic courtesy
of Senna. The captain of the Banshees tumbled backward, landing right
next to S’reee, who took the moment to laugh in the other girl’s face.
Thanks to Boscha’s impromptu gymnastics routine, the ball had slipped
out of her hands and was now rolling ever closer to the Hexside
goalhoop.</p>
<p>Coming from out of nowhere, Loca ran in and quickly picked up the
ball before launching it into the hoop that Boscha was supposed to be
defending.</p>
<p>“GOAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!” the public announcer screamed.</p>
<p><strong>Gorgons 1 – Banshees 0 | 9:22 Remaining | Game 1</strong></p>
<p>Boscha let out a swear from her spot on the ground. She had cost them
the opening score. Now her team was playing from behind, and she was to
blame. Slapping herself on the cheek to wake herself up, she got up and
began slowly walking to the starting circle, trying to catch her
breath.</p>
<p>“NOT DOG!” she screamed, communicating the play for this possession
to her other teammates, though the noise from the crowd was making it
difficult. If the Gorgons played this like Boscha expected, then this
should be a quick answer. “NOT DOG!”</p>
<p>Amelia, Cat, and Skara all nodded. Good, they had heard her.</p>
<p>Taking her spot on the circle, Boscha took one last deep breath
before readying for the ball to shoot.</p>
<p>As the grudgball launched into the air, the Banshees, save for Skara,
all took off, running straight for the Gorgons’ goal. As the ball
reached its apex, Skara looked directly at the ball and put her fingers
to her lips and whistled, sending out her own wave of bard magic. As the
wave travelled, it caught both the grudgball and the Gorgons, all of
whom were midjump. In one fell swoop, the ball was sent rocketing across
the field towards the Glandus goalhoop, and all of the Gorgons were
knocked out of the air like fairies that had just been swatted. “Sorry,
I’m just doing what the play says.” Skara quickly apologized to the
students from the rival school before running to join her teammates.</p>
<p>Cat was the first to receive the ball as it fell from the sky,
positioning herself so it landed right in her breadbasket. Turning to
run with it, she made a point to not turn around and run face first into
a trap. When a battle axe emerged from the ground and started falling,
she was ready for it, diving out of the way so she didn’t get cleaved in
two. From the ground, she turned to see that the Gorgons were getting up
from Skara’s attack. Seeing an opening, Cat called out Amelia’s name
before heaving the ball in her direction.</p>
<p>As Amelia received the ball, she was almost immediately when thorny
vines sprouted all around her, trapping her on a little island of dirt.
Turning herself in a circle, she saw no way out. She couldn’t jump far
enough to get out, and she definitely didn’t want to risk getting all
cut up this early in the game. Help was on the way, though, as Boscha
waved for the ball, and Amelia punted the ball towards the captain of
the Banshees.­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­</p>
<p>Smiling at the chance to make up for her mistake just moments prior,
Boscha ran towards the Glandus goalhoop. Surprisingly, no traps had
sprouted from the ground, so she had a clean shot. Looking behind her,
the only person even close to her was Skara, who had expertly weaved
through all the obstacles. Making a split-second decision, Boscha yelled
out Skara’s name and lobbed the grudgball into the air as hard as she
could. Nodding, Skara sprinted over to the goalhoop and leapt into the
air. As the ball reached the top of its arc, Skara cocked back her hand
and spiked the ball with an open palm, sending it flying through the
hoop.</p>
<p>“Hexside scores,” the public announcer said flatly.</p>
<p><strong>Gorgons 1 – Banshees 1 | 8:46 Remaining | Game 1</strong></p>
<p>As Skara landed, she had a giant grin on her face. “Thanks,
Bosch!”</p>
<p>Boscha brushed off the compliment. “That’s my way of saying sorry. We
still need to obliterate those fools from Glandus.”</p>
<p>While the two rejoined their teammates at the starting circle, Boscha
was already cooking up a plan for this possession. She’d studied the
tape and done her homework. (Well, not her <em>homework</em> homework.
She couldn’t care less about the “proper stirring technique for potion
crafting during a waning crescent.”) Whenever Glandus let up a goal,
they would always try to return with a score of their own by playing
hyper-aggressive, bringing all their players on the offensive and
leaving nobody back deep to defend, relying on the traps and obstacles
to get the ball back. This strategy was risky, obviously, and would
leave them highly susceptible to a quick counterattack by the Banshees
if they could steal away the ball and get a player out in front. As
Boscha took her spot at the starting circle, the perfect play came to
mind.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>Luz wasn’t quite sure why Boscha was yelling about spiders (or not
dogs, for that matter), but she was sure of one thing: Grudgby was
awesome! After Skara’s shot had tied the game up for Hexside, the
basilisk had screamed so hard that her throat hurt, and Gus and Willow
had been similarly enthusiastic about the bard track student scoring. If
both teams kept racking up points like this for the rest of the series,
Luz would undoubtedly lose her voice by the time the third or fourth
match rolled around.</p>
<p>She watched with anticipation as the grudgball rose from the ground
once more, signaling the start of a new possession. While Luz had
expected for the team from Glandus to immediately go for the ball (she
had clocked them to be really attacking-oriented), the Banshees’
response to play resuming was definitely not what she thought was going
to happen. Boscha and her crew <em>backed away</em> from the ball,
fanning out to cover as much of the field as possible. Though Luz
recognized the defensive strategy when she saw it, she was a little
confused as to why they were doing it now, when the game was tied, and
not when they actually had the lead. Maybe they were trying to conserve
their stamina for the next possession? That might be it. Nevertheless,
Luz was excited to see how this possession would turn out. Hopefully it
would end in another Hexside goal, preferably by someone not named
Boscha.</p>
<p>As Luz focused back on the game, she saw that Glandus was trying to
take advantage of the Banshees’ passive approach to the possession. Key
word: trying. Currently, Senna was carrying the ball up the field,
trying to maneuver herself so that a teammate could cut for a closer
shot on the hoop. However, both the Banshees and the field itself were
working against her. Whenever she would try to line up a shot, either an
obstacle would appear to deny the opportunity, or a Banshee would
position themselves between her and the goal. Similarly, if she tried to
pass the ball off to another Gorgon, one of the Banshees would threaten
to either knock the pass out of the air with a blast of magic or jump
and grab it with their bare hands. (Well not, bare. They had gloves on,
after all.) Eventually, and most likely out of frustration, Senna
resorted to blindly throwing the ball as hard as she could at the hoop.
Though the ball managed to avoid Amelia trying to swat it out of the
air, as well as other magical blasts from the other Banshees, the
goalhoop had other ideas.</p>
<p><em>DOINK, DOINK.</em></p>
<p>The ball bounced off the left side of the hoop, and then again off
the bottom before falling backwards, never crossing the barrier to
score. The grudgball landed directly in the arms of Boscha, who couldn’t
hold herself back from laughing at the Gorgons’ rotten luck.</p>
<p>From her spot in the stands, Luz cheered even louder than before. If
they kept playing like this, there was no way the Gorgons were gonna
win!</p>
<h1 id="luz-takes-a-leap-of-faith">Luz Takes a Leap of Faith</h1>
<p><strong>Schlimmtag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Terror
Vortex Field at Glandus High</strong></p>
<p>“GORGONS WIN! GORGONS WIN!” the PA demon screamed. The clock read all
zeroes on the fifth and final game of the series. While Luz was sad that
Hexside lost the series, it was still super close the entire way
through. After the double doink in game one, the Banshees had taken
control for the remaining 8 minutes and change. Game two also went to
the Banshees in a much more convincing win then the previous one, with
Skara and Amelia alone putting up more points than all of the Gorgons
combined. The Gorgons bounced back in game three, though, and kept the
Banshees from sweeping them. Then the Gorgons won again to tie the
series at 2 wins a piece.</p>
<p>When the final game had started, Luz’s voice was already gone, having
screamed herself until she was sore in the throat. All eight players
looked exhausted when the ball launched to kick off the final game,
being powered solely by their spite for the other team. As such, neither
team could muster the energy to score (or play defense, for that
matter), with the final minutes looking more like a brawl than an actual
sport. As the clock was winding down, though, Senna punted the ball
through the Banshees goalhoop, earning Glandus a 1-0 victory, as well as
winning them the series. Luz actually felt happy for Senna, believe it
or not. The girl had rallied her team back from a 2 game deficit, and
that was commendable, even if Luz was cheering for Hexside and not
Glandus. Of course, she would have liked the game more if her team had
won, but she still thought that it was overall really fun.</p>
<p>As Luz, Willow and Gus slowly descended the steps of the Terror Dome,
the basilisk rubbed at her throat. Man, she was probably going to have
to gargle some salt for a couple hours once she got back to the Owl
House. Luz sighed. That wasn't gonna be fun. But then, an idea struck
her. She was a basilisk, which meant she could shapeshift any part of
her body. What if she just… shapeshifted her throat to not be sore?
Pondering that thought, she stopped in her tracks. Back when she was
helping Eda and King deal with the Bat Queen’s babies, she had morphed
her ears away, so maybe it wasn’t too much of a stretch that she could
morph her throat to not feel like sandpaper? It was worth a shot, but
whether it would work was yet to be seen. Scrunching her face up, Luz
closed her eyes and focused.</p>
<p>If Luz had to be completely honest, it was super weird feeling her
throat heal itself, but that meant it was actually working, so she
wasn’t going to complain. Then, the implications of Luz’s newfound
healing ability struck here. How far did her powers extend? Could she
regrow a severed limb if she had enough magic in her system? Shaking her
head, Luz dispelled that thought. She did <em>not</em> want to test that
out, not even risking thinking it into existence.</p>
<p>Running to catch up with Willow and Gus, Luz joined the line to hop
on the bus. Though Luz was a little sad that riding the bus meant she
wasn’t going to get a chance to catch any of those sweet, sweet thermal
updrafts as a dragon, it also meant that she could conserve both magic
and energy, which was probably a good idea. Stepping onto the bus, Luz
instinctively headed towards the back, hoping to get a seat by herself,
only snapping out of autopilot when Willow and Gus squeezed into the
bench with her.</p>
<p>“So, what did you think of your first grudgby game?” Gus asked,
turning to Luz.</p>
<p>“Hmm?” Luz asked, caught off guard by the question. “Oh, that was
awesome! Are all the grudgby games that intense?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, they can get pretty vicious,” Willow responded. “That’s why I
prefer flyer derby, honestly. Less of a chance to get flattened, sliced
in half, or set on fire.”</p>
<p>Luz nodded. “That’s reasonable.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the bus jerked into motion, and they were off.</p>
<p>As Luz opened the door to the Owl House, she was surprised to find
the house empty. Well, Hooty was still there, but he was deep in
conversation with a fly that Luz didn’t want to interrupt. After
checking Eda’s room, the roof, and even the basement, Luz determined
that it really was just her, Hooty, and the fly. (Never mind, Hooty just
swallowed the fly.) Deciding she could use this rare opportunity to
relax, Luz reclined on the couch, kicking her feet up on the coffee
table and flipping on the CB.</p>
<p>As she perused her options of channels, she came to the conclusion
that there was nothing good on.</p>
<p>A shopping channel? No thank you. Next channel.</p>
<p>Emperor’s Coven propaganda? Double no. Next channel.</p>
<p>A static shot of a bag of sticks? Could be worse. Next channel.</p>
<p>A news story about the Owl Beast terrorizing a slayground? Boring.
Nex – Wait what.</p>
<p>Going back to the previous channel, Luz yanked her feet off the
coffee table and leaned forward so she could get a closer look at the
screen.</p>
<p>Yup, that was Eda in her Owl Beast form, and it looked like King was
riding on her back like he was at a rodeo. Eda had something hanging
from her mouth, but the camera was too far away for Luz to see what
exactly it was. According to the chyron scrolling across the screen,
King had shown up with the Owl Beast and had essentially taken the
slayground hostage, and they were currently in a standoff with animal
control, the leader of the group trying to talk King into giving up his
“throne” and letting the other kids go.</p>
<p>Groaning, Luz knew what she had to do. She was pretty sure that she
knew where that particular slayground was, based on the surrounding
buildings she could see. Dashing out the front door, she needed to get
to the slayground fast, which meant she would have to take to the air
once again. Running through her mental catalogue of animals, Luz needed
something that could fly but also wouldn’t draw too much attention to
herself. Finally, she decided on the common red-tailed hawk. Good ole
<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>. (Why Luz knew the scientific name, she
wasn’t quite sure. It had just stuck in her mind from all those years
back when Mamí had taken in a red-tailed hawk at the vet clinic.)</p>
<p>Speeding through the morph, Luz finished in record time and took to
the air as soon as she could. Now that she had a birds-eye view
(literally, in this case), she could make a beeline straight to the
slayground. As the wind flowed over her wings, Luz realized how lucky
she had been when she had been a dragon flying to Glandus. That path had
mainly been over the Boiling Sea, which offered plenty of updrafts to
allow for easy gliding, but now she was flying over the city, where the
thermals were few and far between in comparison. Translation: her wings
were getting tired.</p>
<p>Luz didn’t have time to worry about thermals, though. She had a tiny
demon to talk down from a power trip and an Owl Beast that needed an
elixir like she needed air to breathe. Spotting the slayground was
pretty easy, thanks to all the giant eyeball-camera demons that were
floating in a ring around the perimeter.</p>
<p>Circling down and landing on a very convenient flat roof, Luz quickly
demorphed back into witch-ears mode.From up here, she could clearly see
Eda, King, and all the other children in the slayground. Then Luz
realized her blunder. The roof she had landed on had no way down to
ground level. Unless, of course, she wanted to risk jumping down and
praying that she didn’t break her leg on landing, but Luz wasn’t that
stupid.</p>
<p><em>Rats</em>, she thought. Looking around, the basilisk tried to see
if there was another way down other than jumping, but nothing turned up.
Whelp, if this was her only option, then she was going to need to do it
as something non-human. As Luz remorphed into a red-tailed hawk, she
concocted a plan to get down to the ground that didn’t involve breaking
any bones.</p>
<p>Hopping over to the edge of the roof on her talons, Luz looked down
at the <em>long</em> drop before her and did the sign of the cross as
best she could with her wings.<em>Geronimo!</em> Luz thought to herself
before jumping over the edge. Keeping her wings folded to her side, she
fell like a rock, only flaring her wings out at the last second so that
she didn’t go splat, slowly floating the last few feet until she softly
touched down.</p>
<p>Now that she was on the ground, Luz demorphed (for real this time)
and ran over to the slayground, where King and Eda were still in a
standoff with animal control. Forcing her way through the crowd that had
gathered, Luz approached the leader of the animal control, tapping him
on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“What do you want, girly? Can’t you see I’m busy here?” the demon
asked in a gruff voice.</p>
<p>Crossing her arms, Luz gave him a disappointing stare. “Let me
through.”</p>
<p>The demon laughed. “Fat chance of that happening, kid. Now scram. Us
adults have work to do.”</p>
<p>While he did that, Luz just walked past him, stopping him mid-laugh
as he tried to grab her and pull her back to safety. “King, what the
<em>fudge</em> are you doing?!” she admonished the tiny demon,
clambering up the jungle gym to be face to face with the wannabe
tyrant.</p>
<p>“I’m having fun!” King answered with a happy look on his face.</p>
<p>“Well, you may be, but are any of the other kids having fun? Is
<em>Eda</em> having any fun? Look at her!” Luz motioned to the young
children who were currently huddled in the corner of the little tower,
quivering in their boots at the scary owl thing that was eating the
slayground equipment. As if to hammer home Luz’s point, Eda barfed up a
swing and whimpered sadly.</p>
<p>Looking around at his so-called “kingdom”, King frowned. “No,” he
said softly.</p>
<p>“So, are you gonna let the other kids go?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“I guess so,” King replied. Slowly, he and Eda descended the
slayground tower as Luz hopped down to the ground.</p>
<p>“Ready to head home?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Uh huh!” King said. Eda apparently agreed, as she nodded so
aggressively that King started bouncing up and down on her back like he
was riding a bucking bronco.</p>
<p>“Oi, don’t think you’re getting off that easy!” the leader of the
animal control shouted. “That’s a wild demon that damaged public
property, so it’s going to the pound!”</p>
<p>“Eda is <em>not</em> a wild demon!” Luz yelled back.</p>
<p>“Yeah, look!” King added, reaching into his fanny pack and pulling
out an elixir. Uncorking it, he offered it out to Eda, who grabbed it in
her teeth and flipped her head up to chug the potion.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>“Well, that ain’t good,” Luz commented.</p>
<p>The doors to Emperor Belos’ throne room slowly creaked open, and in
walked the Head Witch of the Healing Coven, Hettie Cutburn. Coming to a
stop before her great emperor, she knelt down in genuflection to the
Titan’s Blessed Leader.</p>
<p><strong>“Rise, Head Witch,”</strong> came the Emperor’s voice,
filling the hall, causing Hettie’s stomach to twist itself into knots.
As she got to her feet, her eyes flitted over to the Golden Guard, who
it seemed was also affected by the Emperor’s proclamation, his so-called
“Right Hand” shaking at the sound of his all-encompassing voice. Once
Hettie was standing, Lord Belos continued. <strong>“Lilith informed me
that you bring news of grave importance. What is it?”</strong></p>
<p>Swallowing the ball that had formed in her throat, Hettie took a
cautious step forward, noting out of the corner of her eye the Golden
Guard’s hand drifting ever closer to his stave. “My Lord, the Warden has
finally recovered from that heinous attack a few weeks back.”</p>
<p>Belos slowly nodded. <strong>“Ahh, yes. Wrath. His presence has been
sorely missed at the Conformatorium. Did he manage to identify who or
what attacked him?”</strong></p>
<p>“That’s where there are some… questions, my Lord. Wrath said that the
creature that attacked him was a basilisk, but they are supposed to be
an extinct species, are they not?” Hettie asked.</p>
<p>From behind his mask, Philip Wittebane raised an eyebrow. It looked
as if one of those miserable creatures had tried to finish the job they
started when they had initially broken out of the Conformatorium.
<strong>“Whether the Warden’s assailant is supposed to be extinct or not
is of little importance, Head Witch. There are far more pressing matters
to be dealt with.”</strong></p>
<p>“Yes, I – I agree, my Lord,” Hettie replied, slowly shifting from
foot to foot as the Emperor’s eyes stared at her.</p>
<p><strong>“Beyond its species, did the Warden describe his attacker in
any further detail? Were there any distinctive markings or
disfigurements?”</strong> Belos inquired. He wondered which of those
miscreants thought it a good idea to assault a member of his coven in
such a brash manner.</p>
<p>“Wrath said that the creature had brown scales with a white spotted
underbelly,” Hettie answered. “That was all he could make out before he
succumbed to hypothaumosis, unfortunately.”</p>
<p>Only one basilisk matched that description. <em>Number Five, you
foolish child</em>, Philip thought. <strong>“Thank you, Head Witch. Was
there anything else the Warden told you that could be of
use?”</strong></p>
<p>“There is, my Lord,” Hettie responded. “If what Wrath has said is to
be trusted, then the basilisk wasn’t working alone.”</p>
<p><strong>“Who would be so bold as to ally themselves with a
basilisk?”</strong> Belos asked. Whoever it was that would willingly
travel alongside one of those infernal beasts must not be right in the
head.</p>
<p>“If Wrath’s memory serves him correctly,” Hettie said, “then the
witch working with the basilisk was none other than the Owl Lady, Edalyn
Clawthorne.”</p>
<h1 id="luz-visits-a-boiling-isles-book-fair">Luz Visits a Boiling Isles
Book Fair</h1>
<p><strong>Schlimmtag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Slamming the door shut, Luz turned her back to it before slumping to
the floor, not even bothering to shift her tail out of the way. Taking
in deep breaths, she did her best to recoup her energy. She had just
spent the past few minutes in a dead sprint, trying to get to the house
as fast as possible. After one more deep inhale, she slowly exhaled.
They’d made it. Outside, she could hear the sounds of Hooty obliterating
the animal control demons who were after Eda.</p>
<p>Eda nervously tapped her back paw. When she had gulped down the
elixir, it didn’t turn her back into her normal form, but it did give
her control over the Owl Beast, whatever good that did her. In fact,
this was probably worse than not having control over the Beast. She
couldn’t draw a spell circle, couldn’t talk, couldn’t do anything useful
thanks to Bird Brain not having opposable thumbs. At least when the
Beast was in control she didn’t have to deal with those
frustrations.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Eda,” Luz reassured her mentor (and herself). “I’ll get
you an elixir lickety split.” Scrambling up off the floor, Luz ran into
the kitchen, with the Owl Lady moseying in behind her. As Luz scaled the
kitchen counter, Eda’s maternal instincts kicked in. <em>Kid, you better
not do anything stupid</em> , she thought to herself.</p>
<p>As Luz teetered precariously on the counter, she reached above her
head and undid the lock on the cabinet. Yanking the door open, Luz stood
up on the tips of her toes so she could see into the cabinet. Scooching
a few miscellaneous potions out of the way, Luz saw her prize. Grabbing
the elixir, she spun on her heel so that she could hop down. Except her
foot slipped.</p>
<p>Time seemed to slow down as Luz fell. Before she could even realize
what she was doing, Eda was running to catch the basilisk before she
could impact the ground. It was only when Luz looked into Eda’s eyes
from being cradled in her arms that Eda realized what had happened.
Firstly, she was somehow back in her regular body again. Secondly, she
had just snatched Luz out of mid-air when she was all the way across the
kitchen just a second before. Deciding to not look a gift snorse in the
mouth, Eda gently set Luz back on her feet. The basilisk dusted herself
off, a goofy smile on her face as she offered the elixir to her
mentor.</p>
<p>"Here you go, Eda!" Luz said, only to realize that Eda looked very
not Owl Beast-y. “Oh, never mind.”</p>
<p>"Thanks, kiddo," Eda replied, ruffling Luz's hair. "But I'm good…
somehow."</p>
<p>“How did you get your body back?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>Eda shrugged her shoulders in response. “Beats me. All I knew was
that you could get hurt, and I wasn’t gonna let that happen. Guess the
Owl Beast agreed.”</p>
<p>Luz smiled. “Aww, you care about me. Maybe it was you going all Mama
Bear that turned you back. You know, a strong emotions kinda thing?”</p>
<p>Eda scrunched her face up. Magic could be influenced when a witch was
in a particularly emotional state, so that wasn’t an entirely unfounded
idea.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Hooty snaked his head into the kitchen. “GUESS WHAT JUST
ARRIVED, HOOT HOOT! IT’S THE MAIL!” Luz watched as a ball of what she
assumed to be letters traveled up Hooty’s esophagus, only to get caught
in his throat. The bird… tube… thing hacked a few times before finally
expelling the ball of letters onto the kitchen floor, all of them coated
in a thin layer of mucus. Scooping up the letters, Eda dumped them on
the table before beginning to sort through them.</p>
<p>“Taxes.” Eda crumpled that one up and threw it behind her, landing
directly in the trash can.</p>
<p>“Scam.” Another letter joined the taxes in the trash.</p>
<p>“Death hex.” Another letter in the trash. After a few seconds,
though, a miniature black hole formed and sucked in the trash can before
disappearing.</p>
<p>Looking behind her, Eda saw that the trash can was no more and
pouted. “Dang.” Turning back to the mail, she continued sorting it
through.</p>
<p>“Book fair reminder.” Eda began to crumple up the letter, but an
audible <em>SQUEE</em> drew her attention. The noise had somehow come
from Luz, who was staring at her with giant puppy dog eyes.</p>
<p>The Owl Lady sighed. “Let me guess, you want to go to the book fair.”
Luz couldn’t even verbalize her excitement, instead responding by
fervently nodding her head.</p>
<p>Eda groaned. “Fine.” Turning upstairs, she shouted to get the
attention of a certain skull-headed demon. “Oi, King! We’re going to the
book fair, so get down here unless you wanna walk.”</p>
<p>Lilith let out a ground of frustration. Her sister was housing a
basilisk, and who knew how much longer Edalyn had until the rabid
creature decided that she was its next meal. When Wrath had awoken from
his coma, she had initially dismissed his rambling about a “giant,
snake-ish demon” draining him of nearly all of his magic as mere
hallucinations. It was only when Lilith met with Head Witch Cutburn and
discussed what a basilisk attack actually looked like did she actually
consider Wrath’s statements. But how could Edalyn have allied herself
with a demon from a supposedly extinct species? Considering that
basilisks had the ability to shapeshift, though, Lilith posited that the
demon could have been hiding in plain sight under a disguise.</p>
<p>But how could Edalyn have found out about the basilisk if it was
concealing its true nature?</p>
<p>Thinking back to her presentation at the Covention, she remembered
that Edalyn had recently taken on an apprentice. What was the witchlet’s
name? Liz? Lice? It was something like that. Regardless of what Edalyn’s
apprentice’s name was, that brought up another question: who did Lilith
meet at the Covention? If that was the actual Liz (or whatever her name
was), then both she and Edalyn were in danger of the basilisk turning on
them at a moment’s notice. If Lilith had met the basilisk, though, then
she didn’t even want to think about what that entailed. The head of the
Emperor’s Coven had a million questions, and only one person could
answer them. Donning her cloak, Lilith silently closed the door to her
office.</p>
<p>Only to turn around and run directly into Steve.</p>
<p>“Hey, Lils! Whatcha doin?” her bodyguard/assistant/friend asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, hello Steve,” Lilith replied awkwardly. “What are you doing
here?”</p>
<p>“My job,” he said slowly. “You know, protecting you from attacks,
scaring away rabid fans, stuff like that.”</p>
<p>“Right, right. That was a stupid question, my apologies,” Lilith
responded, pulling on her signature raven mask that distinguished her as
the leader of the EC.</p>
<p>“So, where are we heading?” Steve asked as he traveled beside his
boss.</p>
<p>“Wherever my sister is,” Lilith answered.</p>
<p>Steve nodded. “This going to be an official thing or is it off the
books?”</p>
<p>“Unofficial,” Lilith said quickly. “Edalyn is rubbing elbows with
dangerous company, and I intend to set her straight before she gets
herself hurt or worse.”</p>
<p>“Ahh, family stuff. Got it,” Steve replied, nodding.</p>
<p>“Do you have any clue where Edalyn might be, Steve? I know that you
are far more of a… social butterknifefly than I am.” While Lilith prided
herself on being the leader of the Emperor’s Coven, all that
responsibility left her with little time to go “out on the town” as it
were.</p>
<p>“If I had to guess, I’d probably say the book fair at the
Bonesborough Public Library,” Steve answered. “It’s going on this week,
and I doubt the Owl Lady would pass up an opportunity to sell her finds
from the Human Realm when the market isn’t open.”</p>
<p>Lilith hadn’t even thought of the annual BPL book fair. “I guess
that’s a better start than nothing. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Luz was having the time of her life at the book fair. It was
everything a bookworm like her could have asked for and then some. There
was a zine-making workshop that she had attended, the leaflet she had
constructed tucked away safely in the pocket of her hoodie. There were
also a few meet-and-greets she had watched from afar. No Mildred
Featherwhyle, obviously, but there was a guy named Volo who had gathered
a considerable crowd as he blabbered about his supposed feats of
daring-do. Luz had to admit that this guy knew how to really ham it up
for an audience. Leaping from table to table, miming out sword fights,
it was a pretty entertaining show, even though it was obviously
hyperbolized.</p>
<p>One thing, or rather, one <em>person</em> that Luz didn’t expect to
see was Amity Blight wandering through the shelves.</p>
<p>“Hey, Amity!” Luz called out to get the emerald-haired witch’s
attention.</p>
<p>Amity turned to see who had called her name and smiled when she
realized who it was. “Hi, Luz. Found any books you want to buy?”</p>
<p>“Not yet,” Luz replied. “I’m sure I’ll find one, though. There’s like
a billion books here.”</p>
<p>Amity laughed. “This place is big, but it’s not <em>that</em> big,
okay.” Reaching into her bag, she then withdrew <em>The Good Witch
Azura: Fall of Zargothrax</em> and offered it to Luz. “And before I
forget, here’s your book back.”</p>
<p>Luz waved her hand in dismissal. “No, I told you that you could keep
it, and I meant it. That’s yours now.”</p>
<p>“Oh, thanks then.” As Amity placed the book back in her bag, a slip
of paper between the pages caught her eye. Oh crud, that was the drawing
she had made of herself and Malingale the Mysterious Soothsayer. Amity
was really thankful that she got to keep the book now. If Luz had seen
the drawing, she probably would have never let the young Blight live it
down.</p>
<p>“So, what did you think of the book?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“It was… good,” Amity responded.</p>
<p>Luz gasped. “‘It was good’? That’s all you have to say about Hecate’s
incredible friends-to-lovers arc with Azura as they travel together
through the Desert of Despair to find the Amulet of Amore?”</p>
<p>“Okay, yeah, I was happy to see them finally get together. At least
Featherwhyle didn’t force them into a ‘will they, won’t they’ thing and
stretch it out over a couple books.” Amity admitted</p>
<p>“Yeah, that would have been not cool,” Luz agreed.</p>
<p>“Lily, what are you doing?!” Eda’s voice broke through the background
noise of the fair.</p>
<p>“Amity, get away from that creature right now,” Lilith shouted.</p>
<p>Luz and Amity turned to see both of the Clawthorne sisters
approaching them, Lilith storming ahead while Eda was trying to talk her
down from whatever it was she was trying to do. The elder sister then
placed herself between Luz and Amity before drawing a spell circle and
leveling it at Luz.</p>
<p>“Uhm, what are you doing, Ms. Clawthorne?” Amity asked her old
mentor.</p>
<p>“I’m protecting you from this dangerous creature,” Lilith
responded.</p>
<p>“Lily, be rational for one second,” Eda pleaded after catching up to
the group.</p>
<p>“I am,” Lilith replied coldly. “This vermin has replaced your
apprentice, and I intend to deliver it back to where it belongs.”</p>
<p>“‘Replaced’? Lily, what are you talking about?” Eda asked, feigning
confusion about what her sister meant.</p>
<p>“Your so-called apprentice is actually a basilisk,” Lilith said,
pointing a finger at Luz.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know,” the Owl Lady replied with a smirk.</p>
<p>Lilith froze as her brain tried to comprehend what she just heard.
Edalyn knew and she didn’t care. That confirmed it for Lilith. The curse
had messed with Edalyn’s brain so much that she was somehow fine with
living with what was essentially an apex predator.</p>
<p>“You realize that means that that creature could drain you of all
your magic at any second, right?” Lilith was dumbfounded at her sister’s
apathy to the revelation.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but she’d never do that,” Eda retorted. “Would you ever do
that, kiddo?”</p>
<p>“Nope, never in a million years!” Luz responded with a smile.</p>
<p>“Sorry to butt in, but I have to agree,” Amity said from behind
Lilith. “I’ve never felt in danger when around Luz. Well, except for
when we met at Hexside, but that doesn’t count.”</p>
<p>“Aww, thanks Amity,” Luz said.</p>
<p>“If you’re not evil, then why did you assault Warden Wrath at the
Conformatorium?” Lilith asked.</p>
<p>“Because he cut off Eda’s head,” Luz said as if it was the most
obvious thing ever.</p>
<p>Lilith raised a finger to object before considering what she would
have done if she was in that situation. “Alright, I’ll give you
that.”</p>
<p>"Thank you," the basilisk replied.</p>
<p>Eda clapped to get everyone's attention. "Well, that's great. Now
that we're all friends, how about we do something more productive than
threatening my student, hmm?" Turning around, the Owl Lady started
walking away.</p>
<p>"I suppose that would do us good," Lilith said.</p>
<p>Bending down, the witch then whispered into Luz’s ear. “Listen,
creature, and listen well. You may have fooled Edalyn, but I am not so
easily convinced. You say you mean her no harm, and I implore you to
keep your word. If I find that you have harmed my sister in any way, I
will have your head on a platter before Lord Belos by nightfall. That is
not a threat, that is a promise. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>Luz nodded. She understood perfectly.</p>
<h1 id="luz-starts-her-writing-career">Luz Starts Her Writing
Career</h1>
<p><strong>Schlimmtag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Bonesborough
Public Library</strong></p>
<p>As Luz skimmed through the offerings at the book fair, dragging a
finger along the spines of the books, Lilith’s words echoed in the back
of her mind. <em>“If I find that you have harmed my sister in any way, I
will have your head on a platter before Lord Belos by
nightfall.”</em></p>
<p>If Luz had to be completely honest with herself, she was at least a
little scared by what the leader of the Emperor’s Coven had said. Dying
was something that seemed very not fun, and she hoped she didn’t
experience it until she was like 90 years old and senile.</p>
<p>Deciding that none of the books looked that appealing, Luz turned
elsewhere to see if there was some booth or event that she had missed.
That was when she saw it: <strong><em>Short Story Writing
Competition</em></strong> . How had she missed that? It even had a giant
banner and everything!</p>
<p>Back before Luz’s life had gotten flipped-turned upside down by
learning that she wasn’t exactly a human, she had dreamt of being an
author and having her stories sitting alongside Mildred Featherwhyle’s
on a child’s bookshelf. Given that Luz was in a completely different
realm, though, that put a small kink in her plan. Nevertheless, a
writing competition seemed like a great way to kick start her
professional literary career.</p>
<p>Speed-walking over to the booth - running would have looked quite
uncouth - Luz positioned herself in front of the triclops running the
table, she waited for them to notice her. After the demon came to a
stopping point in their book, they bookmarked their page before setting
the book aside. Looking up at Luz, they smiled. “Are you looking to join
the short story competition?”</p>
<p>“Yup!” Luz replied with a smile of her own.</p>
<p>“That’s great to hear,” the triclops replied. “There’s a few rules
that your story has to follow, though. Since this competition is for
<em>short</em> stories, there’s a word limit of 7500 words. The topic of
the story and the format it’s presented in can be whatever you like, so
it could be a traditional story, a fake obituary, anything. Besides
that, go wild with your story. Submissions have to be turned in by the
end of the week, and the best story will get a prize of 250 snails.
Still want to sign up?”</p>
<p>“Yes, please,” Luz said, nodding her head. She couldn’t believe that
she was actually going to be competing against other writers. This was
going to be so fun! Well, there was also that 250 snail prize, but that
was just an afterthought for the basilisk.</p>
<p>Reaching below the table, the triclops produced a sheet of paper with
tons of signatures on it as well as a pen. “In that case, just add your
name here and you’ll be in the running.”</p>
<p>Taking the pen, Luz was just about to add her name when an idea
struck her. “Hold on, can I team up with another person for my
story?”</p>
<p>After thinking on it for a few seconds, the triclops responded. “I
don’t see why not.”</p>
<p>Putting the pen down, Luz held up her index finger. “Give me just one
second, then.” The basilisk already had the perfect idea for who she
wanted her co-author to be. Turning around and scanning the fair-goers,
she looked for a certain green-haired witch that she knew was in
attendance.</p>
<p>When she finally spotted Amity, she saw that the witch was talking
with King, a book held above her head and out of reach of the tiny
demon. Walking over, Luz caught the backend of the two’s
conversation.</p>
<p>“For the last time, I’m not letting you summon Crayak the Destroyer,
King,” Amity said. As Luz got closer to the two, she saw that the book
Amity held was called <em>Summoning Minions for Dummies</em> .</p>
<p>“But I really wanna!” King replied, stamping his foot. (Luz thought
that King looked absolutely <em>adorable</em> when he was trying to be
intimidating.)</p>
<p>“King, just listen to Amity,” Luz interjected herself into the
conversation. “I doubt summoning a dude nicknamed ‘The Destroyer’ will
lead to anything good.”</p>
<p>Recognizing that he was now getting outvoted 2-1, King relented.
“Okay, but can I still see the book?” He then tried to pull a cute face
by folding his hands and batting his eyelashes, but Amity was
immune.</p>
<p>“No,” she responded flatly. Placing the book back in its spot on the
shelf, the witch then looked down at the diminutive demon. “But, there
are other fun things you can do here.”</p>
<p>King harrumphed and crossed his arms. “Like what?”</p>
<p>“Well, I know that there’s going to be a book reading with Jon de
Plume and the book is going to be super gory and disgusting.” Amity
explained.</p>
<p>King gasped. “Really?”</p>
<p>“Really,” the witch replied.</p>
<p>“Where is it?” King asked.</p>
<p>“All the way on the other side of the library,” Amity answered. “I’d
hurry, though, because it starts in just a few minutes. You don’t want
to miss it, do you?”</p>
<p>“Never!” King shouted, running off to the (fictional) book
reading.</p>
<p>“Woah, that’s the first time I’ve ever seen King listen to someone
besides me and Eda,” Luz said. “How’d you do it?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been working with kids for years. Sometimes you’ve just got to
speak their language for them to do what you want,” Amity replied. “How
do you live with King 24/7?”</p>
<p>Luz shrugged her shoulders. “Eh, you get used to his antics after a
while. All his talk of death and mayhem is for show. Usually.” The
basilisk still vividly remembered when King had come back to the Owl
House absolutely soaked in blood. He’d said he was just playing a game
with a “weird-looking tube demon with a ton of teeth“ that “went
kablooey” after King bonked it with a stick and the demon started eating
itself. It had taken nearly an hour to wash all the blood off of the
skull-faced demon.</p>
<p>“I guess that makes sense,” Amity said. “Sorry about what Ms. Lilith
did back there, by the way. I’ve never seen her act like that.”</p>
<p>“She wasn’t like that when we met at the Covention.” Then, something
clicked in Luz’s mind. “I guess her learning that I attacked one of her
coworkers would sour her opinion of me.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I would probably act the same if I saw someone who attacked
you,” Amity said.</p>
<p>“Well, thanks for having my back, then,” Luz replied, drawing the
girl into a side hug.</p>
<p>“So what is it you came here to talk about?” Amity asked.</p>
<p>Luz paused as she tried to actually remember why she was over here.
Oh yeah, the competition! “There’s a short story competition being held,
and I was wondering if you would want to team up with me so that we
could work on a story together. If we win we'll get 250 snails.”</p>
<p>Amity looked intrigued. “Hmm, that does sound pretty fun. Count me
in!”</p>
<p>“Great!” Luz responded. “Let’s go sign up!”</p>
<p>Leading the way, Luz weaved through the crowds of people as she made
her way back to the booth promoting the competition. As the two got
closer, the triclops from before noticed their approach.</p>
<p>“I see you’ve found your co-author,” they said.</p>
<p>“Yup!” Luz replied. “We’re gonna come up with something that will
blow the Titan’s socks off!”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be that ambitious, but I think we’ve got a good shot at
winning,” Amity said confidently, draping her arm over Luz’s
shoulder.</p>
<p>“I like the enthusiasm,” the triclops said with a laugh. Handing over
the sign-up sheet and a pen, Luz signed her name with a flourish before
handing the sheet and pen over to Amity, who added her signature below
Luz’s. As Luz returned the sheet and writing utensil to the triclops,
she noticed Amity’s handwriting. It was very pretty and refined, each
letter evenly spaced and the same size, as if she had practiced it a
thousand times over.</p>
<p>“Alright, with that you’re officially in the running for the
contest,” the triclops said. “Be sure to have your submission in by the
end of the week.”</p>
<p>“We will, thank you,” Amity said.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the Owl House and get started writing! We don’t have any
time to lose!” Luz suggested, anxiously grabbing Amity’s hand to pull
her towards the exit of the library.</p>
<p>“Wait, I need to let Malphas know I’m leaving early then,” Amity
said, slowly pulling her hand free from Luz’s grip.</p>
<p>“Oh, okay then,” Luz responded. “You know, I should probably find Eda
and let her know as well. Don’t want her to think I’ve gone
missing.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like a plan. Meet up back here then walk over to the Owl
House?” Amity suggested.</p>
<p>“Yeah that’ll work,” Luz agreed.</p>
<p>Carrying the corkboard in from the attic, Luz propped it up on the
easel that she had situated in her bedroom. Grabbing a pair of
notecards, she wrote the words “Act I”, “Act II”, and “Act III” on them
before pinning each up on the board. Now the hard part: coming up with
the actual story.</p>
<p>Hopping down from Luz’s bed, Amity walked over to stand beside the
basilisk.</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Luz tapped a finger to her chin in contemplation. “What kind
of story should we do?”</p>
<p>“Maybe a romance?” Amity suggested. “Like, have the characters meet
at a cafe or something.”</p>
<p>“Eh, I think that’s just a smidge overdone though. Seems a little
fanfic trope-y to me,” Luz replied.</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay, I see where you’re coming from,” Amity said.</p>
<p>“How about we do something more like an action or an adventure?” Luz
was always a sucker for a good <em>Lord of the Chains</em> type of
story. Characters traveling together and building a sense of trust and
camaraderie with one another was right up Luz’s alley. (Plus, the
characters spending so much time alone together on the road meant that
her shipper heart could go wild.)</p>
<p>“I would say yes to that,” Amity replied, “but we’ve got to keep the
story short, and I don’t think we could do a full action story justice
in just a few thousand words.”</p>
<p>“Darn, you’re right,” Luz admitted. “Okay, what about… a slice of
life story? That one we could definitely fit in like 5-kay words.”</p>
<p>Amity thought about the suggestion. “Yeah, that’d probably work.”</p>
<p>“Alright, so we’ve got the genre down,” Luz said. Scribbling “Slice
of Life” on a notecard, it was soon added to the Corkboard of Great
Story Ideas.</p>
<p>“Next up, characters,” Luz continued. An idea immediately sprung to
mind. Grabbing a marker, Luz quickly drew a caricature of herself in
Azura’s signature robe and hat, even wielding the Magic Staff of
Awesomeness that was totally canon and definitely not something the
Latina had made up for her self-insert fanfic that she’d written a few
years back.</p>
<p>Tacking the drawing up on the corkboard Luz announced the name of the
main character. “Luzura. Boom, main character done.”</p>
<p>Amity laughed. “Oh my Titan, you have a cringey OC too?”</p>
<p>The basilisk gasped. “Luzura is <em>not</em> cringey, thank you very
much.” She then actually processed what the witch had said. “Wait, you
have an OC? What’s their name?”</p>
<p>“Do you promise not to laugh?” Amity asked, blushing at the thought
of sharing such an embarrassing part of herself.</p>
<p>“What could be worse than Luzura?” Luz replied. “It’s not even that
creative!”</p>
<p>“My original character is called… Oraios,” Amity finally admitted.
“It means ‘beautiful’ in some Human Realm tongue.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that is just absolutely precious,” Luz said. Grabbing another
notecard, she began to write down Amity’s OC when she realized that she
had no idea how to spell the character’s name.</p>
<p>“Wait, how do you spell that?” she asked.</p>
<p>“You’re actually going to include her?” Amity asked, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Well, if we’re going to be including cringey OCs, we’re going to be
including cringey OCs together,” Luz replied.”How do you spell her
name?”</p>
<p>“O-r-a-i-o-s.” Amity spelled the name letter by letter, with Luz
meticulously copying it down.</p>
<p>Pinning Amity’s OC next to her own, Luz soon added another notecard
above the two: <strong><em>Our Protagonists</em></strong> .</p>
<p>“Alright, characters are set, let’s hammer out the plot,” Luz
announced. “Got any ideas, Ams?”</p>
<p>“Ams?” Amity was caught off guard by the nickname.</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry. I can call you Amity if you want,” Luz replied.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that I don’t like it,” the witch clarified. “It just
surprised me. I don’t think anyone has ever called me ‘Ams’ before.”</p>
<p>“Well, the question still stands,” Luz said, pointing at Amity with
her pen. “Got any ideas for the plot besides a ton of fluffy, slice of
life goodness?”</p>
<p>Amity tapped her finger against her chin in a thinking motion before
smiling. “Yeah, I’ve got some ideas.”</p>
<p>Now with a corkboard bursting packed full of plot threads and
snippets of conversation, it was time to actually start the writing.
There was a small issue, though: they didn’t have anything to write
with, and there was no way they would handwrite the entire story if it
was going to be as long as they expected. So, Luz turned to rummaging
around in the nooks and crannies of the house to see if she could find
something to write with that wouldn’t leave her with carpal tunnel
syndrome or something.</p>
<p>After rooting around in one of the many closets, Luz found an old,
dusty typewriter hidden away behind a rack of jackets. It wasn’t a
typewriter like Luz was used to. (Given, she’d never actually used a
typewriter, but she knew what one looked like from those British TV
shows Mami watched occasionally.) This typewriter looked pretty normal
except for the fact that it had a pair of eyes, teeth and a tongue where
the back of the machine should be. Grabbing the machine, Luz held it at
arm’s reach, waiting to see if anything would happen.</p>
<p>Eventually, the typewriter opened its eyes and looked up at Luz.
“You’re not the Owl Lady,” it said.</p>
<p>“Nope, I’m her apprentice,” Luz clarified. “Is it okay if I, like,
use you to write a short story.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I was made for, wasn’t I?” the typewriter responded.</p>
<p>“Alright, thank you,” Luz said.</p>
<p>Returning to her room, the basilisk set the typewriter down on her
desk. After taking a deep breath and cracking her knuckles, Luz, with
Amity looking over her shoulder, began typing out their literary
masterpiece.</p>
<h1 id="luz-embraces-the-elements">Luz Embraces the Elements</h1>
<p><strong>Schlimmtag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Leaning back from the typewriter, Luz flexed her fingers to get some
feeling back in them. She really wished that she had packed her laptop
in her backpack when she’d crossed over into the Isles. Why? Because
whenever she’d make a typo, she’d have to grab some White-Out, paint
over the mistake, and then wait for it to dry before spelling the word
correctly. In her opinion, that took way too much time when she could
have been spending it making the story even better. Still, though, it
was super fun to actually get into the groove while writing about Luzura
and Oraios dressing up in all sorts of cute outfits and traveling
together, visiting tons of cool places that definitely weren’t modeled
after places in Gravesfield.</p>
<p>All told, the story - tentatively titled “Chasing Rainbows” - stood 9
pages long, and it had taken shape through the combined power of Luz and
Amity’s incessant nerd-dom. Luz could count at least 17 different Good
Witch Azura references that she had snuck into the manuscript. Ranging
from surface level nods, like mentioning The Sandwich, to deeper cuts,
such as a suspiciously named side character running over trash cans with
a truck, anybody who was as obsessed with GWA as Luz was would pick them
up easily.</p>
<p>The story wasn’t all Luz, though, as she and Amity would switch off
on who was writing every time there was a new scene or a change in the
point of view. It was a pretty good system in Luz’s opinion, giving both
of them a chance to read over what was being typed out. It was
especially helpful to make sure that everything was getting explained in
enough detail. From Luz’s experience of writing GWA fanfics, she knew
how important it was to have someone else check over your work to make
sure there wasn’t anything missing.</p>
<p>Removing the final page from the mouth of the typewriter, Luz stacked
the paper together and tapped them on her desk to straighten them out.
“And we… are… done!” Laying back in her chair, the basilisk took in a
few deep breaths.</p>
<p>Hopping off Luz’s bed, Amity picked up the stack of papers and slowly
flipped through them. “Wow, I can’t believe we got the entire thing
finished in one sitting.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Luz replied. “And my fingers only hurt a little bit!”</p>
<p>Pulling out her scroll, Amity checked the time. Yup, just as she had
suspected: the library had already been locked up for over an hour by
now. “Dang, they’ve already closed up for the night.”</p>
<p>Luz pouted at the news. “Well, drat. We can turn it in tomorrow,
though. Plus, it’ll give us more time to look it over and make sure it’s
the best story it can be.”</p>
<p>“That’s a good way to look at it,” Amity said before a buzz from her
scroll drew her attention. Checking the notification, she saw that Edric
had sent her a few messages in quick succession.</p>
<p><strong>bestBlight:</strong> yo have you packed for the trip to the
Knee tomorrow</p>
<p><strong>bestBlight</strong>: em and I already got our stuff
together</p>
<p><strong>bestBlight</strong>: mom says you gotta do good on the
presentation “or else”</p>
<p><strong>bestBlight</strong>: also dad isn’t coming</p>
<p>Amity groaned. She’d completely forgotten that she was supposed to go
to the Knee with Ed and Em to train for her part in the presentation.
Each of the nine tracks had picked a representative to show off their
skills for an inspector from the Emperor’s Coven, and Amity had been
chosen and the representative from the Abomination trick. What made the
trip to the Knee worse than normal was that dad wasn’t even going to be
there. Since he was on par with Head Witch Deamonne in terms of
knowledge about Abomination magic, her father would probably have given
her some highly-detailed lecture about how to make the Abomination bend
to her will. Given, that would only happen if he could find the time to
actually care about his children more than his inventions, and Amity
knew that was rarer than finding a fairy that didn’t have a taste for
flesh.</p>
<p>Noticing Amity’s dour look, Luz frowned. “What’s got you down in the
dumps all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>The witch sighed before fully responding. “I’ve got to go to the Knee
tomorrow to train with Ed and Em. I was chosen to represent the
Abomination track for Hexside’s annual Emperor’s Coven inspection next
week, and Mother will be… not happy if the presentation goes
poorly.”</p>
<p>Luz inhaled sharply. “Dang, that sucks.”</p>
<p>“Tell me about it,” Amity responded, flopping onto Luz’s bed and
spreading her arms out, draping them over the bed frame.</p>
<p>“Well, would it be less sucky if I was there, training with you?” Luz
offered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’d make it more bearable,” Amity responded, “but you’d
probably get bored just watching me do the same spells over and over.
What would you even be training for?”</p>
<p>“The placement exam at Hexside,” Luz said. “Eda told me about the two
spell requirement, and we’re pretty sure glyphs will count for it.”</p>
<p>Propping herself up on her elbows, Amity met Luz’s eyes. “Wait…
You’re going to Hexside?!”</p>
<p>“Yep,” the basilisk answered. “Did I not tell you?”</p>
<p>“No! That’s awesome, Luz!” Amity was amazed that Luz had kept this
great news from her. “Do you know what track you’re going to join?”</p>
<p>“Right now, I’m leaning towards Beast Keeping,” Luz responded.</p>
<p>“Oh, really? I thought you would take after Eda and go down the
Potions track,” Amity said.</p>
<p>“I’ve considered Potions,” Luz started, “but I feel like Beast
Keeping would be a better fit for me. My mom is a veterinarian, after
all, so I’d be sorta following in her footsteps.”</p>
<p>“What’s a ‘veterinarian’?” Amity asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, right, that’s a Human Realm thing,” Luz said. “A veterinarian is
kinda like a mix of Beast Keeping and Healing. Mami specializes in pets,
so dogs, cats, snakes, things like that.”</p>
<p>“Huh, that’s interesting,” Amity replied. “I’ve never considered
mixing types of magic like that.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well us humans don’t have magic, so we make do with
technology,” Luz explained.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard Gus talk about human technology a lot,” Amity said. “Is
it true that you guys actually have giant metal birds that can fly you
around?”</p>
<p>“Ahh, those are airplanes,” Luz recognized what Amity was talking
about after a second. “Yeah those are pretty common in the Human Realm
because of how spread out we all are.”</p>
<p>“Wait, ‘spread out’?” Amity was confused. “Do humans not all share
the same Titan?”</p>
<p>“No…” Luz replied slowly. “We’ve got continents, though, and I guess
those are kinda like Titans. Well, except for the fact that they’re just
giant chunks of Earth’s crust floating on the mantle.”</p>
<p>“The Human Realm sounds weird,” Amity said. “Nice, but weird.”</p>
<p>“Well maybe it won’t be so weird once I show you around,” Luz
responded. “I know some cool hangout spots.” (That was a lie, but Amity
didn’t need to know that Luz was a friendless loser back in the Human
Realm.)</p>
<p>“I’d like that” Amity mentioned.</p>
<p>“I think I would, too.”</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>Slamming the door to her office shut, Lilith threw off her cloak,
letting it pool up on the floor. Burying her head in her hands, she let
out a muffled scream. How her sister was turning a blind eye to the fact
that she was living with an indubitably blood-thirsty (and most likely
magic-hungry) monster, Lilith wasn’t sure. The beast had somehow
convinced Edalyn and her former protégé that it meant them no harm.</p>
<p>But what if they were telling the truth? When Lilith had been
training under Flora D’splora in her early days of the Emperor’s Coven,
Ms. D’splora had drilled into the impressionable young Lilith that the
historical record can never be blindly trusted. Falsities and
half-truths could easily be passed off as gospel if it was backed well
enough, so perhaps she was wrong about basilisks.</p>
<p>That was a train of thought for another time, though. Right now, all
Lilith wanted to do was to retire for the night. After she had changed
out of her uniform and into more casual attire, Lilith began mindlessly
flipping through channels on the CB. After a few minutes of a whole lot
of nothing, she gave up on that plan and decided that she might as well
put a dent into the mountain of paperwork clogging her desk that she’d
been ignoring for the past few days.</p>
<p>The monotony of filing papers was one that Lilith enjoyed. The
repetitive actions allowed her to turn her mind off for a few hours as
she sorted everything into its proper category and signed the occasional
document. After she’d gotten through the first few papers, Lilith slowly
got more into the zone, tuning out the outside world as she worked. That
was until she was staring at a report that numerous students and faculty
at St. Epiderm had been attacked by an unknown assailant and left
without magic. Maybe the historical record surrounding basilisks was
accurate after all, because Lilith had an idea of who she thought the
culprit was.</p>
<p>A knock at the door drew the witch’s attention. Barely picking her
feet up off the ground, she shuffled over to the door to see who was
willing to pester her at such a late hour. If they were willing to
bother the leader of the Emperor's Coven when it was nearing midnight,
then they were clearly also willing to part ways with their post in the
coven. Opening the door revealed that it was Kikimora who was standing
on the other side. Great, one of the two people Lilith couldn’t fire.
(The other being that obnoxious Golden Brat, and Lilith was about 90%
sure the current Golden Guard had gotten their position solely on the
fact that they were related to the previous Guard.)</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Lilith snapped, hoping to get this interaction
over with as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>“Emperor Belos has requested an audience with you. I suggest you not
keep him waiting,” the demon said in that grating voice of hers.</p>
<p>Throwing on her cloak, Lilith forced her way past Kikimora and began
walking to Lord Belos’ chamber.</p>
<p>“Oh, and one more thing,” Kikimora called out.</p>
<p>“What?” Lilith turned around, an annoyed look on her face.</p>
<p>“Don’t think that your little escapade off to the library didn’t go
unnoticed. Now hurry along. The Emperor is not a patient man.”</p>

<p><strong>Zorntag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The
Knee</strong></p>
<p>Luz shivered and wrapped her arms around herself in a sort of
self-hug, doing her best to conserve warmth. This coat was <em>not</em>
helping. Blowing into her hands, she tried to warm them up to no avail.
She was starting to doubt whether she was really warm-blooded, because
this place was capital C Cold.</p>
<p>The trek up the mountainous terrain had not been kind to the
basilisk. She really wished she had a thick layer of fur like that giant
Abominable Snowman looking thing she’d passed by on the way up. What had
Eda called it? “Slitherbeast” or something along those lines? Luz wasn’t
really paying attention to Eda’s impromptu lesson at the time, instead
being more focused on not freezing to death.</p>
<p>“Are you sure that you’re good, kiddo?” Eda asked. She had tagged
along with Luz, claiming that she “didn’t want to see her kid get turned
into a Popsicle” and that the basilisk needed adult supervision.</p>
<p>“Never better!” Luz said with a fake smile, giving a weak thumbs
up.</p>
<p>“We can set up a fire if you want,” Amity supplied. “That is one of
the spells I’m learning, after all.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’d be nice,” Luz replied through chattering teeth.</p>
<p>“We can go get some firewood,” Ed and Em said at the time.</p>
<p>“You can give that fire spell a shot while we’re out,” Edric
mentioned to Amity before he and his twin disappeared off into the
woods.</p>
<p>Once the two were out of earshot, Luz turned to the remaining Blight
sibling. “Do they… know?”</p>
<p>“Know what, exactly?” Amity replied, a look of confusion on her
face.</p>
<p>“About me being, ya know, scaly?” Luz explained, hoping the
emerald-haired witch would get the implied message.</p>
<p>“Oh, uh, no. I haven’t told them,” Amity said. “Unless you want me
to, that is.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather you not,” Luz responded. The less people who knew about
her true nature, the better. “I wanna keep it on a need to know basis.
Guess I’ll have to keep the witch disguise for the next few hours,
then.”</p>
<p>“That’s reasonable,” Amity stated before changing the topic away from
Luz’s heritage. “So, what spells are you going to be performing for your
placement exam? I know you’ve got that light spell, but you need at
least two to get out of the baby classes.”</p>
<p>Luz gasped. “I never showed you the plant glyph!” Reaching into her
pocket, she pulled out her notepad and a tiny pencil. Quickly sketching
out the glyph, Luz tapped it, and out of the piece of paper sprung a
small gardenia flower. Plucking it by the stem, Luz offered the flower
out to Amity.</p>
<p>“Boom, plant spell!” the basilisk said with a smile.</p>
<p>Taking the flower, Amity examined it. “That’s amazing. Thank you,
Luz.” Tucking the flower behind her ear, the witch brushed her hair back
so that the gardenia was more clearly visible.</p>
<p>“How do I look?” Amity then asked, striking a pose for the
basilisk.</p>
<p>Luz laughed. “You look like you just stepped out of a magazine that
sells winter gear.”</p>
<p>“I hope that’s a good thing,” Amity replied.</p>
<p>“Hey, we didn’t come here for a fashion show, you two!” Eda
interjected. “We’re here to train, not galavant around in the snow.”</p>
<p>“I guess we probably should start training,” Amity admitted. “Don’t
want to be out here in the cold for nothing.”</p>
<p>“What spell did you say you wanted to work on, Blight? A fireball or
somethin’?” Eda asked.</p>
<p>“Fireball, yeah. I can’t even summon one with a training wand,
though,” Amity replied, clearly exasperated.</p>
<p>“Well that can’t be right,” Eda said. “Any witch your age should be
able to cast a basic elemental spell. Lemme see the wand.”</p>
<p>Reaching into her back pocket, Amity pulled out a smooth wooden stick
with what looked like a power gauge attached to it. Handing the wand
over to Eda, the Owl Lady examined it.</p>
<p>“This thing’s in perfect condition,” Eda stated before handing the
wand back to its owner. “It is charged, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I made sure to charge it all night,” Amity replied.</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Eda tapped at her chin, thinking. “Well, if the wand ain’t the
issue, then I’m pretty sure how you’re using it is the problem. How do
you try to cast spells with it?”</p>
<p>“I try to cast them like I would an actual spell circle,” Amity said
slowly. “Is that not how you’re supposed to do it?”</p>
<p>“No,” Eda responded flatly, “and that’s where your issue comes from.
When you cast magic with a spell circle, you have to focus that magic
from your bile sac to your finger and out. Training wands, on the other
hand, already have the magic primed and ready to go, so you just have to
point it in the right direction and hope you don’t blow anything
up.”</p>
<p>“So I’m basically asking the wand to do too much and then it doesn’t
know what to do?” Amity hoped for clarification.</p>
<p>“Basically,” Eda said. “Now try to cast a fireball spell, but don’t
overthink it this time.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” Amity said hopefully. “I can do this.” Taking a deep
breath, the youngest Blight aimed her wand at a patch of snow. With a
quick flick of the wrist, a small fireball formed at the edge of the
wand and waited to be released.</p>
<p>Staring at the fireball, Amity cracked a smile. “Yes! Wooh!” Jabbing
the wand forward, she sent the fireball screaming towards the snow bank,
where it melted a hole straight through the pile, only to be filled in
when the pile collapsed in on itself.</p>
<p>“Yeah! Go Amity!” Luz cheered, happy to see her friend happy.</p>
<p>“Good job, Blight,” Eda congratulated the other witch. “Now how hard
was that?”</p>
<p>“What’s all the yelling about?” Edric asked as he and Emira returned.
Ed had his arms full of chopped up logs, while Emira carried a bundle of
kindling in one hand with a bag of tinder in the other.</p>
<p>“I got the fire spell to work!” Amity said proudly.</p>
<p>“Oh, nice. Good job, Mittens,” Emira congratulated her sister on the
accomplishment.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s get this fire started, then,” Eda said. “I’m freezing
my tail feathers off over here.”</p>
<p>“You have tail feathers?” Edric asked, confused by the
expression.</p>
<p>“Yes, I really do have tail feathers,” Eda replied in a deadpan
voice. “No, I’m just cold. Did any of you richy-riches bring a fire
pit?”</p>
<p>“No,” Emira said. “Mom said they were a waste of money.”</p>
<p>Eda sighed and rubbed at her forehead. “Of course she did. Looks like
we’re doing this the hard way, then. Ready for a survival lesson?”</p>
<p>Clapping her hands together and rubbing them, the Owl Lady then
started scooping out the snow with her hands. Eventually, the hole began
to take on a square shape, and when it was completed, Eda patted the
remaining snow down so that it was level.</p>
<p>“Tinder,” she proclaimed, motioning for Emira to add it to the box,
who complied. Eda bunched the small sticks and leaves until they were in
a roughly circular shape.</p>
<p>“Kindling.” The larger sticks were smushed together into a roughly
cylindrical shape sticking out of the square. Holding the kindling in
place, Eda moved onto the final step of constructing the fire.</p>
<p>“Logs.” The first log was squished into the square and was soon
joined by its companion on the other side of the kindling cylinder.
Finally, the two other logs were placed atop the first two, laying
criss-cross, acting as a sort of outline of the square.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t hard, was it?” Eda said as she got to her feet.</p>
<p>“Where’d you learn to do that?” Luz asked her mentor.</p>
<p>“Human realm,” Eda replied concisely.</p>
<p>“You gonna elaborate on that?” Luz followed up with.</p>
<p>“Nope,” Eda said, popping the “p” emphatically.</p>
<p>“Now come on, let’s light this sucker up,” Eda proclaimed. “Hey, Baby
Blight, how bout you do the honors?”</p>
<p>Stepping aside, Eda gave Amity the floor. Kneeling down in the snow,
Amity pulled out her training wand and pointed it at a section of the
tinder in the center of the pit. Summoning a tiny flame at the end of
the wand, Amity attempted to light the tinder, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>“Hmm, looks like the wood is still wet from the snow,” Eda noted,
“Put some more magic into the flame and see if it’ll catch.”</p>
<p>“You got it,” Amity replied. Willing the flame to grow bigger, she
put it to the tinder once more, but the sticks still refused to
light.</p>
<p>“Come on, work with me here,” Amity said to the wand. The wand seemed
to listen, as the flame grew far bigger, instantly lighting both the
tinder and a chunk of the kindling.</p>
<p>“Nice work, kid,” Eda praised the young witch. “Wanna see if you can
get the logs going too? Speed up the process a lil’ bit, ya know?”</p>
<p>“I guess I can give it a shot,” Amity replied. Pouring even more
magic into the flame, it grew bigger still, now nearing the “that’s way
too big to be safe” size, and Amity reacted accordingly. Falling on her
behind in surprise, Amity launched the fireball off in a random
direction so that she didn’t turn himself into roast witch.</p>
<p>Luz watched as Amity’s fireball arced across the sky before dipping
below the treeline and disappearing.</p>
<p>“Think you might have put too much power into that one, Mittens,”
Emira said, clapping a hand on her sister’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Well, uh, let’s hope that I didn’t hit anything,” Amity said,
forcing a laugh.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a roar echoed through the whole of the Knee, and a shadow
fell across the camping party. Looking up, Luz saw a giant mass of white
fur flying through the air, and it was headed right towards them.</p>
<p>Landing with a loud <em>THUD</em> in front of the Blights, the
slitherbeast roared, droplets of goo flying from its mouth and landing
on their faces.</p>
<p>“Oh Titan,” Amity squeaked.</p>
<p>“Everyone scatter!” Eda yelled. Grabbing Luz’s hand and dragging the
basilisk along, Eda dove to take cover behind a boulder.</p>
<p>As Edric and Emira ran for the woods, Ed noticed that his younger
sister wasn’t following. “Amity, come on!” he yelled.</p>
<p>Amity stood frozen as the slitherbeast got closer. The smoking wand
in her hand was a dead giveaway that she was the one who had woken the
beast from its slumber. She wanted to run and join her siblings, but her
legs refused to cooperate, keeping her rooted in place.</p>
<p><em>I wonder what they’ll write on my tombstone</em>, Amity thought
as she felt the slitherbeast wrap its paw around her waist. (The grip
was lighter than she expected. Maybe the beast wanted to play with its
food before eating her?)</p>
<p>“HEY UGLY! LET HER GO!” Luz shouted, running from her place behind
the boulder.</p>
<p>“Luz, what are you doing?” Eda hissed.</p>
<p>The slitherbeast slowly turned around as it faced the weird
two-legged creature yelling at it.</p>
<p>“YOU HEARD ME! LET GO OF MY FRIEND YOU BIG OAF!” Luz continued. She
just needed to draw the slitherbeast a little bit closer and it’d be in
range.</p>
<p>The slitherbeast took slow, lumbering steps as it stomped towards the
two-legger. Once the tiny creature was within arm’s reach, the
slitherbeast swiped to grab at the annoying pest, only for it to dive
out of the way and open its mouth.</p>
<p>As Luz drained the slitherbeast of its magic, she hoped that it
wouldn’t have enough energy to fight back, because if it did then she
was as good as squashed. Fortunately, luck was on her side, and the
slitherbeast fell to its knees before eventually face-planting in the
snow. Unfortunately, Amity also ended up with a faceful of snow as a
result, but Luz hoped that the snow would also cushion the witch’s fall.
After a few seconds of waiting to see if the slitherbeast was truly
unconscious, Luz dashed over to her fallen friend.</p>
<p>“Amity! Amity, are you okay?” Luz asked as she helped the girl get to
her feet.</p>
<p>“I’m… I’m fine,” Amity replied after a pause to gather her bearings.
“Just a little shaken up, that’s all.”</p>
<p>As Luz checked her friend for any injuries, she couldn’t help but
feel that something was off, but she couldn’t quite place what exactly.
When Amity whipped her head back and forth to shake the snow free from
her hair, only then did Luz realize what was missing: Amity’s
flower.</p>
<p>Luz gasped. “Where did the flower go?!”</p>
<p>Amity was confused. “Luz, it’s fine. I don’t –”</p>
<p>“I’m finding that flower!” Luz proclaimed.</p>
<p>Scouring the surroundings, the basilisk searched for the gardenia,
cursing the fact that it was a white flower hidden on a backdrop of
white snow.</p>
<p>“Hey, uh, Mittens?” Emira slowly approached her sister. “Were you
ever gonna tell us that your friend can… do whatever that was?”</p>
<p>“Not really,” Amity said, fidgeting, trying to figure out how much
she should divulge about Luz’s true nature. “That’s more for Luz to
decide.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Eda chimed in. “Luz’s powers are none of your beeswax. If she
wants you to know, she’ll tell you.”</p>
<p>“Oh my Titan, I found it!” Luz called out. Running up to Amity, the
basilisk held the gardenia gently in her hand. Amity couldn't help but
notice that Luz was coated head to toe in snow, and Amity doubted that
that could feel good.</p>
<p>“Luz, you didn’t have to go through the trouble of finding me a silly
flower,” Amity said.</p>
<p>“But I wanted to,” Luz retorted. “You deserve the flower.”</p>
<p>Getting closer to Amity, Luz brushed back the witch’s emerald locks
and gently placed the flower back behind her ear.</p>
<p>“See?” Luz gestured to nobody in particular. “Now the outfit’s
perfect! The flower ties the whole thing together.”</p>
<p>Off to the side, Eda saw how Amity looked when Luz got close to the
young Blight, the subtle blush not slipping past the Owl Lady’s watchful
eye.</p>
<p><em>Oh, that kid’s got it bad.</em></p>
<p>Deciding that it was time to run intervention before Amity melted
into a puddle, Eda got everyone’s attention with a shout. “Anybody know
what we should do with Big Ugly over here?” Summoning Owlbert, Eda poked
at the sleeping (Well, <em>hopefully</em> sleeping.) slitherbeast with
the butt of her staff to see if the thing was still alive. When the
demon weakly batted at the staff, Eda let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“I vote that we just leave it be,” Luz offered.</p>
<p>“I agree,” Amity said. “Just because it gave me a spook doesn’t mean
we should… kill it.”</p>
<p>“Alright, half the ballots have been cast,” Eda said. “Dweebus One,
Dweebus Two? What do you guys think?”</p>
<p>“Can I keep him?” Edric asked with a childlike expression.</p>
<p>Everyone turned to stare at the teen.</p>
<p>“What? He’s cute, and I want a pet!” Ed said, trying to argue his
case.</p>
<p>In response, Emira grabbed her brother by both shoulders and stared
him in the eye. “Ed, I love you, but that is the stupidest idea I’ve
ever heard.”</p>
<p>Edric frowned. “Fine, no slitherbeast. How about a bat instead?”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>

Experiences the Epic Highs and Lows of Hexside</h1>
<p><strong>Spasstag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Hexside School
of Magic and Demonics</strong></p>
<p>“Okay, kiddo, are you ready for your placement exam?” Eda asked. She
and Luz were currently hiding in the left wing of the stage of the
Paranormatorium at Hexside. On the other side of the curtain, Principal
Bump sat at the ready, waiting for Luz to begin.</p>
<p>“Yup!” Luz replied. “I’ve got my glyphs, my backup glyphs, my backup
backup glyphs, my backup backup backup – ”</p>
<p>Eda laughed and snorted. “Alright, alright. I get it.” She then took
on a more serious tone. “You’re gonna do great, kid. I just know that
you’re gonna blow Bumpy-poo’s socks off. Now, are ya ready?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!” Luz replied excitedly.</p>
<p>“That’s what I like to hear. Go knock ‘em dead, kiddo!” Eda said,
giving Luz a quick hug of encouragement.</p>
<p>Approaching the curtains, Luz took a deep breath. “Let’s do this,”
she said to herself, before running through the curtains and onto the
stage.</p>
<p>“Hi, Principal Bump,” the basilisk said meekly.</p>
<p>“Hello, Miss Noceda,” Bump replied. “Now, are you going to show me
the spells you know, or are you going to keep me waiting like you have
for the past quarter-hour. I do have a school to run, you know.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry,” Luz apologized. Reaching into her fanny pack, she
pulled out a plant glyph. “So, umm, this is my plant glyph.”</p>
<p>Tapping the glyph, a sunflower emerged from the note card, going from
shoot to a fully-fledged flower in seconds. Bump nodded his head and
made a quick scribble on his sheet.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s one spell. What’s the other?” the principal asked.</p>
<p>“Right. Umm, well… I’ve also got a handy-dandy light glyph,” Luz
said. Pulling out a light glyph, the girl tapped it, only for the spell
to be way more powerful than she expected.</p>
<p>“Oh sweet Titan!” Luz covered her eyes and stumbled away from the
surprise flash-bang. If she was better coordinated, she most likely
would not have tripped over her own two feet, but that was not the case.
As Luz fell, she watched in slow motion as the backup glyphs (and backup
backup glyphs and backup backup backup glyphs) tumbled out of her fanny
pack and landed on the stage, all of them right where she was about to
land.</p>
<p>Landing on the stage with an audible <em>OOF</em>, Luz felt all of
the glyphs activate. As the surrounding area momentarily turned into the
world’s brightest and blandest light show, dozens of vines sprouted from
the glyphs and covered the fallen girl. Crawling out of the garden of
vines, Luz tore herself free. Slowly getting to her feet, she cracked
her neck before dusting a few stray flowers off her shirt and picking
more of the stragglers out from her fanny pack.</p>
<p>“I still pass, right?” the basilisk asked Principal Bump, hopeful
that the mess she caused didn’t disqualify her outright.</p>
<p>“Yes, you do,” Bump answered, walking over and handing her a pamphlet
describing all the great tracks she could join. “Luz Noceda, I now
welcome you as a member of the student body of Hexside School of Magic
and Demonics.”</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p><strong>Gehetag 3, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Hexside School
of Magic and Demonics</strong></p>
<p>As Eda Luz flew to Hexside for Luz’s first day of school, the Owl
Lady was busy giving some last-minute advice to the basilisk. Some of it
was good:</p>
<p>“Your locker will eat you if given the chance.”</p>
<p>“Trouble guards won’t always be there to save you, so you might have
to fight other students.”</p>
<p>“That said, don’t drain a student of their magic just because they
called you names.”</p>
<p>Some of it was questionable at best, though:</p>
<p>“The quickest way to get out of an assignment you forgot to do is to
say that your palisman ate it.”</p>
<p>“The detention pit’s favorite flavor of gelatin is spicy
eyeballs.”</p>
<p>“To assert dominance, punch the first kid you see right in the
schnoz.”</p>
<p>As Owlbert touched down at Hexside, Luz quickly hopped off the
palisman, but Eda stopped her before she could head off to school. “One
last thing, kid. Do you remember how to get to my shortcut room?”</p>
<p>Luz nodded. “Uh huh, I draw that keyhole thingy and push it in to get
in the room.”</p>
<p>Eda smiled and ruffled the girl’s hair. “Good. If you ever get lost,
overwhelmed, just want some alone time, whatever, go there.”</p>
<p>“Got it,” Luz nodded once and gave a thumbs up. As she turned to head
off (for real this time), Eda stopped her once more.</p>
<p>“What, no goodbye?” the Owl Lady said.</p>
<p>Rolling her eyes, Luz ran up to the old witch and gave her a side
hug, before the Owl Lady turned it into a full one. “You’re gonna do
great, kid. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, and if they do then I
want you to kick their butt.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Eda,” Luz said softly before breaking free from her mentor’s
embrace and finally walking off to officially join Hexside.</p>
<p>While the basilisk moseyed down the path towards her new school, she
pondered what classes she would be taking on the Beast Keeping track.
Would she be getting up close and personal with all sorts of cute and
creepy creatures, or would it be more like a ton of lectures with no
actual animals? Those thoughts went by the wayside when she saw her
friends lounging around the front steps of the school.</p>
<p>“Hi, Gus! Hey, Willow!” Luz called out to the two witches, running to
catch up with them.</p>
<p>“Hello there, fellow classmate,” Willow said with a knowing wink.</p>
<p>“Congrats, Luz!” Gus added. Spinning up a spell circle,
<em><strong>YOU’LL GET IT NEXT TIME</strong></em> appeared in shimmering
blue text. Upon noticing his mistake, the illusionist quickly dispelled
the message, not missing the glare that Willow was giving him. “Whoops,
sorry. Wanted to make sure I had all my bases covered.”</p>
<p>“So,” Willow started, hoping to distract Luz, “are you ready to
become a full-fledged student here at Hexside?”</p>
<p>“I can’t wait,” Luz replied, barely holding back a squeal of
excitement. “It’s gonna be so awesome!” Pausing to steel herself, the
basilisk then walked towards the large double doors that opened to
Hexside proper. “Whelp, I’ve gotta go confront the big boss man about
picking a track, so catch you guys on the flip side!”</p>
<p>“Good luck!” Willow encouraged her friend.</p>
<p>“You’ve got this!” Gus said, and he spun up another message, this
time reading <em><strong>WE’RE CROW-CALLING ABOUT YOUR RATWORM’S
EXTENDED WARRANTY</strong></em>. As Willow leveled another glare at the
boy, he quickly got rid of the illusion. “I’ll just… uh.. stop doing
that.”</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>Stepping into Principal Bump’s office, Luz saw that the headmaster of
Hexside was busy watching some news report on a crystal ball. The CB
showed numerous witches, all of them in various states of consciousness
strewn about on the ground, with most sharing unhealthily palid skin.
Noticing the arrival of his newest student, Bump quickly shut the CB off
before storing it away on the shelf to his side.</p>
<p>“Ahh, Miss Noceda, just the student I was looking for,” Bump started,
his tone a bit too cheery for Luz’s liking.</p>
<p>“Heya, Princy B. Is it cool if I call you that?” Luz asked in a
similarly upbeat manner, firing finger guns in his direction.</p>
<p>“No,” Bump responded flatly. “Now, on to the matter at hand. Or,
really, two matters.”</p>
<p>Luz cocked an eyebrow before responding slowly. “Okay?”</p>
<p>“Firstly,” Bump started before clearing his throat and leaning over
his desk, taking on a hushed voice. “Were you the one who attacked
Glandus?”</p>
<p>“What.” Luz gave the older witch a blank stare. Was that Glandus that
she’d seen on the CB? She probably didn’t recognize it given that she’d
only been there once before.</p>
<p>“I won’t rat you out to the Emperor’s Coven, if that’s what scares
you,” Bump continued.</p>
<p>“I think there’s been a misunderstanding,” Luz replied. “The last
time I was at Glandus was for the grudgby game. I don’t have a grudge or
anything against them.”</p>
<p>It was Bump’s turn to raise an eyebrow in confusion. “Oh, really?
Well, that is certainly a development. I thought you had attacked them
as revenge for losing the grudgby game.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Bump, I don’t even remember where Glandus is,” Luz said.</p>
<p>After leaning back in his chair, Bump spoke again. “Well, in that
case my apologies for levying such an accusation against you. So, have
you determined what track you would like to join?”</p>
<p>“Yup!” Luz responded. “I want to join the Beast Keeping track.”</p>
<p>Nodding in approval, Bump spun a quick spell circle, and Luz watched
as the white sleeves and leggings of her uniform shifted to match the
burnt orange of the Beast Keeping track. Reaching into a cabinet under
his desk, Bump pulled out a sheet of paper and handed it to Luz. “Here
is your class schedule. I suggest you hurry along, as your first class
starts in…” Bump looked at his CB to check the time, “15 minutes.”</p>
<p>“That’s cool and all,” Luz said as she still had a question that she
wanted answered, “but what are we gonna do about my cover story of a
messed up bile sac?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have that taken care of,” Bump replied. “You’ll get all the
accommodations that you need. I won’t have you failing a class just
because you can’t cast a spell circle.”</p>
<p>Luz nodded. “Awesome. Thanks, Princy B!”</p>
<p>Bump opened his mouth to tell the basilisk not to call him that.
However, by the time that he thought to do that, the girl had already
run off. Sighing, the principal decided that now was a better time than
ever to ensure that the entire school was in tip-top shape for the
Inspector from the Emperor’s Coven.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>Looking down at her schedule, Luz saw that the courses she would be
taking were an interesting selection, to say the least.</p>

<p><strong>Dead Beasts and You – Room 315 – Mr. Acheron Bestatter –
3:00-3:45</strong></p>
<p>Well, at least she knew when lunch was. Now she just needed to figure
out where all the other classes were. Looking to see if there were any
signs to point her in the right direction, she saw none. Darn. Whelp,
time to see how friendly a random student is.</p>
<p>Approaching another student dressed in the orange of the Beast
Keeping track, Luz introduced herself. “Hi. Umm, so I’m a new student
here, and I’m looking for room 205. Where is that, exactly?”</p>
<p>“205 is down the north-east wing, past the second bank of lockers,”
the student responded, pointing in the direction of the mentioned wing
of the school. “Are you going there for Beastly Bio?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’ve got it with Ms. Nascimento first thing,” Luz said.</p>
<p>The other student whistled. “Dang, you’re lucky. I’m stuck with
Bestatter, and he can’t teach bio to save his life.”</p>
<p>Luz recognized the name. “I’ve got Bestatter for Dead Beasts and You.
Is he good in that class?”</p>
<p>The other student just shrugged. “I dunno, pretty sure it’s his first
semester teaching the class.”</p>
<p>Luz sucked in a sharp breath. “That’s… great.” (It was not, in fact,
great.) “Well, thanks for the directions.”</p>
<p>“No problem,” the other student replied.</p>
<p>Rounding the atrium, Luz walked over to the wing that the student had
mentioned and past the first two sets of lockers. Yup, that was room
205, all right. Just in case Luz wasn’t sure she was at the right place,
a plaque next to the classroom door said 205 on it.</p>
<p>Entering the room, Luz saw that about half of the seats had already
been filled. Was there assigned seating in this class? She should
probably ask, as she didn’t want to accidentally sit in someone else's
spot. Approaching Ms. Nasciemnto’s desk, she waited for the teacher to
acknowledge her.</p>
<p>Looking up, Ms. Nascimento met Luz’s gaze and smiled. “Well, I
haven’t seen you before. Are you Luz Noceda by chance?”</p>
<p>“Yup, that’s me,” the basilisk said in affirmation.</p>
<p>“Great. This class is very much theory-based,” Ms. Nascimento
explained, “so your bile sac… situation won’t present much of an
issue.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sweet!” Luz replied, before remembering why she came up here in
the first place. “By the way, is there a seating chart or anything that
I have to follow?”</p>
<p>“Nope, you can sit wherever. Just try not to be too disruptive,
please,” the teacher answered.</p>
<p>“You’ve got it, teach,” Luz responded before going to claim a seat.
Eventually settling on an open chair in the middle of the room, the
basilisk readied herself for class.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>In Luz’s opinion, her first class period had gone well. Ms.
Nascimento’s “lecture” was mainly just ice-breakers and introductions
for all the new students. There wasn’t much real content about the
biology of beast demons, which kinda bummed Luz out. It seemed like a
cool topic. However, Ms. Nascimento did let everyone leave class a few
minutes early, so that was nice. Currently, Luz was trying to figure out
where “Hexside Fields” was, but to no avail.</p>
<p>And then the bell screamed. In seconds, the relative quiet of the
halls turned to pandemonium. As a mass of students filled the halls, Luz
felt herself get swept up in the wave of witches and demons moving from
one class to another. Nope, there were way too many people! Everything
was so loud, and Luz couldn’t even hear herself think. She needed to get
out of here!</p>
<p>Breaking free from the crowd of students, Luz scrambled into an empty
classroom. Grabbing a stray piece of chalk, the basilisk quickly
sketched out the keyhole symbol that would lead to Eda’s room of
shortcuts. Pushing the square symbol, the chalkboard folded in on
itself, opening a hole in the board that Luz could just barely fit
through.</p>
<p>Grabbing onto the lower edge of the hole, Luz hoisted herself into
the hallway that led to the room. Once she was fully in the hall, she
turned around to see if there was a handle or anything that she had to
pull to close the room off to the outside world, but there wasn’t
anything. Letting out a sigh of relief that she was free from the chaos
of the halls, she turned back around to explore the room of shortcuts.
That was, until she found herself face-to-face with a spell circle aimed
right at her.</p>
<p>“You’ve got ten seconds to explain how you found this place, or this
is the last room you’ll ever see alive.”</p>
