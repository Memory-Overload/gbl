<h1 data-number="2" id="luz-races-an-owl">Luz Races An Owl</h1>
<p><strong>Saturday, May 22, 2021 | 8:24 A.M. | The Noceda
Household</strong></p>
<p>Luz gave her luggage for camp one last look over.</p>
<p>The blue duffel bag had about 2 weeks’ worth of clothes in it, mainly
consisting of cargo/athletic shorts, t-shirts, hoodies, and a few pairs
of jeans. Some leggings and an ill-fitting button-up shirt were also
scrunched in there last minute just in case she needed something more
formal. With some creative outfit combos, she could wear a new outfit
every single day of camp if she wanted to. (Knowing Luz, though, she
would probably just end up wearing her favorite blue-and-white cat
hoodie most of the time.)</p>
<p>The black-and-green duffel bag held her larger items. Her personal
laptop (Somehow, it was still chugging along even after all these years.
“The AMV-inator”, as Luz called it, ran really well, considering its
age.), the laptop’s power cable, her drawing tablet, the tablet’s
charger, her sketchpad, and a few charcoal pencils. She wanted to have
every possible creative outlet at her disposal if an idea struck
her.</p>
<p>Finally, there was her backpack, which contained her most important
possessions: her phone, its charger, and Good Witch Azura books 1-5. She
would only be taking the standard versions of the books though, as she
didn’t want to risk her Collector’s Editions being ruined by some snobby
bully with no taste for such literary masterpiece. She had saved up her
allowance for nearly two months to buy that set from her local
Applegrant Bookshop, and the books sat proudly on her shelf, surrounded
on all sides by all the Azura and Hecate figurines she had collected
over her years in the GWA fandom.</p>
<p>“Luz, are you almost ready to go?”</p>
<p>“<em>Sí</em>, <em>mamá</em>. Just making sure I have everything
packed up.”</p>
<p>In his terrarium, Reggie had apparently been awoken by the sudden
noise of conversation, as he began looking around, head swiveling to and
fro. Noticing her pet, Luz walked over to the baby green tree python and
squatted down to be level with him.</p>
<p>“Alright, Reggie. I’m gonna be gone for a while. That means that mom
is going to be taking care of you. You have to promise to be good for
mom, okay? Can you do that for me?” Reggie quickly flicked his tongue in
and out, tasting the air in a gesture that Luz took to mean <em>Yes</em>
in Snake-ese.</p>
<p>“Nice chat.” Reggie responded by slumping to the floor of the
terrarium and doing his best impression of an over-cooked spaghetti
noodle.</p>
<p>Swinging her backpack on and grabbing a duffel bag in each hand, Luz
made her way downstairs to the main foyer. She then let her mom know she
was ready for camp with a shout of, “How much time till the bus gets
here?”</p>
<p>“It won’t be here for another 30 minutes, <em>cariño</em>.”</p>
<p>Sighing, Luz set down her bags and walked into the kitchen to get
some last-minute breakfast before heading off to camp. Opening the
fridge revealed a dearth of any appealing food options. Three-day-old
Chinese food wasn’t exactly the most nutritional breakfast one could
have.</p>
<p>Switching over to the pantry, she saw a lone package of instant
oatmeal with a ginger and maple flavor. Deciding better this than
nothing, Luz skimmed the instructions on the packaging and quickly
prepared the meal.</p>
<p>The oatmeal was ok. A solid 6.5/10.</p>
<p>Looking at the clock on the wall, the bus was supposed to arrive in
about 15 minutes. Picking up her bags and walking out the door with an
“I’m gonna go wait outside!”, Luz readied herself for the worst and most
boring three months of her life.</p>
<p>She waited for the bus to arrive.</p>
<p>And waited.</p>
<p>And waited some more.</p>
<p>Eventually, her shoulders began to ache, so she set her bags down. It
had definitely been more than 15 minutes. It had to have been. Maybe the
bus was just running late? That could happen. So Luz waited even
longer.</p>
<p>Luz gave up. She turned to walk back inside when she heard a
<em>HOOT</em> sound. Turning to locate the noise, she saw a tiny owl
with her backpack in its beak. The owl met eyes with her and it looked
like it had gotten caught red-handed. (<em>Or would it be
red-winged?</em> Luz thought to herself) The owl turned and started
hopping away as fast as possible, backpack still in tow.</p>
<p>“Oh no you don’t!” Luz yelled, and the chase was on. Luz sprinted
after the little owl, who was deceptively fast. Every time she thought
she was going to catch the fleeing avian, the owl started hopping a
little bit faster and was out of her reach again. The owl ended up
hopping its way into an old, abandoned house through an open front door
and disappearing from Luz’s line of sight.</p>
<p>Luz was normally against doing things like breaking the law, but in
this one incredibly rare instance, she didn’t care. It was time for a
little breaking and entering. Maybe. All Luz knew was that she wanted
her bag back. So with a primal scream, Luz ran through the open door.
Suddenly, the door behind her slammed shut and a bright yellow light
filled her vision.</p>
<hr />
<p>Camila looked out her bedroom window, expecting to see her daughter
getting ready to hop on the bus to camp.</p>
<p>Luz was nowhere to be seen. Her bags were still there, but their
owner wasn’t.</p>
<p>“<em>Mija,</em> you forgot your bags outside.”</p>
<p>No response.</p>
<p>“Luz? Hello? Are you here?”</p>
<p>Still nothing. It wasn’t like Luz to give the silent treatment.
Something was off about this.</p>
<p>Camila ran down the stairs and outside. The realization slowly set
in.</p>
<p>Luz was gone.</p>
<p><strong>30 Minutes Later</strong></p>
<p>A bus pulled up to the Noceda household. Traffic had been absolutely
awful, and they were nearly a half hour late because of it. Nobody was
there, and no cars were in the driveway. The driver simply shrugged and
drove to the next house on their list. They weren’t paid enough to care
about one kid being late.</p>
