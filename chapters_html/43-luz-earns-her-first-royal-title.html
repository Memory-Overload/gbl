<h1 data-number="43" id="luz-earns-her-first-royal-title">Luz Earns Her
First Royal Title</h1>
<p><strong>Gehetag 2, Seventh Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Hexside
School of Magic nd Demonics</strong></p>
<p>Luz took a deep breath as she put her textbooks away in her locker.
If she wanted to even have a chance of Amity saying yes, she would have
to pull off everything perfectly. She only had one chance to pull this
off, and if anything went even the slightest bit awry then it would all
be for naught. Steeling herself, the basilisk closed her locker and
headed off to the classroom that Willow and Gus had stationed themselves
in.</p>
<p>“Are 100% sure that you’ll have enough bile?” Luz asked, looking in
Gus’ direction.</p>
<p>The Illusionist shrugged. “It’ll only be what? 30 seconds max? Not to
toot my own horn, but I can do that in my sleep.”</p>
<p>Luz gave a playful scoff. “Okay mister, you don’t have to brag about
your grandioso.”</p>
<p>It was now or never. Taking one last breath to ready herself, Luz
nodded. “Let’s do this.”</p>
<p>Nodding in kind, Willow exited the room, heading off to find a
certain Abomination witch. While Willow was out searching for her
“victim”, Luz and Gus got to work preparing their portions of the
Gromposal. Reaching into her backpack, Luz pulled out two things: first
was <em>The Good Witch Azura: Battle For The Welttree</em> with a very
specific page bookmarked via a sticky note. Tossing the book over to
Gus, the boy got to reading the frankly overly-detailed description of
the scene. Next, Luz withdrew a sketch that she’d made of her personal
adaptation of Azura. Sure, she was going to be taking a few creative
liberties, but it was still easily recognizable as the Good Witch
herself. Concentrating on her morph, Luz felt herself grow taller and
her hair lengthen as it began to trail down her back. Those were just
the ones she could feel, though. Keeping focused on the morph, Luz
willed her hair to turn the signature Azura green.</p>
<p>Grabbing her phone and navigating to the camera app, she examined the
changes. Everything looked pretty much perfect, physically wise. Now was
the hard part, though: the outfit. Azura’s outfit had so many minute
details that Luz had to get exactly right. From the trim pattern at the
end of the cape to the shine of the gem inlaid into the hat, Luz had to
match it all.</p>
<p>(Okay, well she didn’t have to 100% be a carbon copy according to
what Eda had said when she ran the idea by the Owl Lady, but Luz was
also too much of a perfectionist to let even the slightest blemish go
unfixed.)</p>
<p>Slowly, Luz’s Hexside uniform shifted and changed just like her body
had. The arm sleeves and leggings specifying her chosen magic tracks all
turned to match the white-and-mauve color scheme, while her tunic melded
into the sleeves so that it was a single piece of cloth. At the same
time, her typical Hexside- approved sneakers morphed into the stylish
boots Azura used to kick the butt of evil all across the universe.
Finally, there was the piece de resistance: the hat. Reaching into her
backpack yet again, Luz grabbed the old baseball cap that Eda had
yoinked from the Human Realm. Placing the hat snug on her head, the
basilisk completed the final changes of the morph from weird and nerdy
Luz to the cool and awesome Azura.</p>
<p>Patting her hands against her cheeks, Luz remembered something. She
had almost forgotten it in the rush to get ready: she needed to change
her voice! The last time she had tried to impersonate a made up person,
Bump had called her bluff in like 10 seconds, and Amity would probably
be able to tell it was Luz even faster. Letting out a small “Dang it!”,
Luz got to work on shifting her vocal cords so that she sounded more
like the Azura from the movie.</p>
<p>(The first movie, specifically, since that was the objectively better
and more accurate to the source material Azura adaptation. She was still
salty that the movie studio wouldn’t pony up the big bucks to bring back
the original actor for the second movie.)</p>
<p>As her vocal cords warped and changed, Luz was just making random
noises, trying to get a good gauge of what she should change.
Eventually, she settled on a voice that was a fair bit deeper than her
own and was just a touch gravelly. That would be good enough for
now.</p>
<p>Luz let out a slow breath. “Alright. I think I’m ready. You ready,
Gustanamo?”</p>
<p>“Yup!” he replied. “This shouldn’t be too bad, all things considered.
Not lots of moving parts, which is nice.”</p>
<p>“Well then, shall we get in our places?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll go hide in the corner,” Gus said.</p>
<p>“Hey, you’re the most important part, man,” Luz said, giving him a
side hug. “You’re bringing this whole thing to life, so give yourself
some credit.”</p>
<p>“I guess,” he said reluctantly. Looking down at his watch, he checked
the time. “Willow and Amity will probably be here soon, so I need to
hide. What’s the human saying? ‘Break an egg’?”</p>
<p>Luz laughed at the boy’s malapropism. “Break a <em>leg</em>, I think
you mean.”</p>
<p>Gus gasped and leaned back, a look of disgust on his face. “Eww,
what?! Why would you want someone to get hurt? How is that a good
thing?”</p>
<p>“Actors are weird,” Luz simply replied. “And beyond that, uhh… I
dunno why they say it, actually.” Shaking her head, she refocused on the
task at hand. “Regardless, we need to get in position.”</p>
<p>Nodding, Gus hid himself behind a collection of cauldrons and started
spinning up the illusion. Luz, for her part, just had to be out of
direct eyesight of the door which wasn’t too hard to do, just taking a
few steps to the side and posing herself to be all magical and graceful
like how the real Azura would carry herself.</p>
<p>As the door to the classroom slowly opened, Luz said a silent prayer
to whoever was listening that this would go off without a hitch.</p>
<hr />
<p>Amity was getting a little tired of following Willow through the maze
that was Hexside’s hallways. The Plant witch had shown up out of nowhere
and just grabbed her by the arm and told her to follow, and it wasn’t
like Amity had a good reason to retaliate. Classes weren’t for another
20 minutes, and Amity could count on Professor Hermonculus to spend the
first 10 minutes of class so busy degrading the students that he
wouldn’t notice her absence, so that meant Amity had plenty of time for…
whatever this was.</p>
<p>“Just one more turn and we’ll be there,” Willow said.</p>
<p>“Seriously, Willow, why are we going so out of the way?” Amity
asked.</p>
<p>“You’ll see,” Willow stopped in front of a random door and smiled.
“Head on in.”</p>
<p>Sighing and rolling her eyes, Amity slowly pushed the door open.</p>
<p>There was a lot of things that Amity was thinking this could have
been. Maybe it was Willow trying to get back into Abominations and she
wanted Amity to give her a few pointers. Maybe there was some grave
world-ending danger on the loose and they needed to fight it off. There
was a lot of possibilities going through Amity’s mind about what could
be on the other side of the door.</p>
<p>Whatever they were, though, was nothing compared to what she actually
saw. It was if someone had taken the Garden of Grand Reveals and brought
it to life inside the classroom. Trees of all colors and varieties stood
tall, reaching up into the sky, far beyond what should’ve been possible.
Stumblebees flitted to and fro, pollinating the many flowers that
sprouted from the earth below their feet. Amity could even hear the
rapids of the Raging Red River far off in the distance.</p>
<p>Beyond all that, though, was one thing that caught Amity’s eye.
Standing in the middle of the Garden was the Good Witch Azura, letting
the gentle breeze flow through her hair and ruffle her cape in a scene
that looked straight out of a storybook.</p>
<p>“Azura?!” Amity couldn’t believe her eyes at who stood before
her.</p>
<p>“Greetings and salutations, traveler,” Azura said, turning to face
the newcomer and bowing low.</p>
<p>“You’re… you’re real!” Amity was trying her best to hold back her
excitement, but she was talking with freaking <em>Azura</em>!</p>
<p>“Yes, I do believe I am,” Azura said with a small smile.</p>
<p>“How -” Amity stumbled over her words. “How are you are here? Why are
you here?”</p>
<p>Azura let out a sigh. “Well, it is quite a story, I must say. Would
you be willing to listen?”</p>
<p>Amity nodded fervently. “Uh huh, yeah, tell me!” She answered maybe a
tad too eagerly.</p>
<p>Azura nodded stoically. “It all started around a month ago. I was
just about to finally defeat the nefarious Gildersnake and banish it for
all eternity, when I felt an odd force. It was like I was being
separated from reality. When I finally awoke, I was here in the Boiling
Isles. I was originally going to try to return to my own reality as
quick as I could, but something compelled me to stay here. To explore.
And through that exploration, I’ve discovered something. While I’ve had
enough adventures to last me a dozen lifetimes, this world offered me
one even greater than all of my previous escapades combined.”</p>
<p>“Really, what is it?” Amity was on the edge of her proverbial
seat.</p>
<p>“I’m not quite sure what I would call it,” Azura admitted. “But I
think you would be a great companion for me on this adventure. I only
have one question for you, though.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Azura stood up straight and removed her hat. Looking Amity
in the eye, her face began to shift and change, her hair becoming
shorter and darker, her eyes changing in a flash from green to golden
brown. After what felt like an eternity, but was realistically only a
few seconds, the face of Luz Noceda was looking back at her.</p>
<p>“Amity Blight, will you go to Grom with me?”</p>
<p>Amity fainted.</p>
<hr />
<p>Luz rushed to catch the falling Amity, scooping her up before there
was unfortunate meeting between her face and the floor. Thinking
quickly, the basilisk dragged the unconscious witch over to one of the
desks that they’d moved over to the wall and sat Amity down in it.</p>
<p>Willow and Gus quickly joined Luz in checking up on their friend, but
they were careful not to crowd her.</p>
<p>“Well… she didn’t say no?” Luz said with a shaky laugh.</p>
<p>Willow shot her a look. “I don’t think now is the best time to be
making jokes.”</p>
<p>As quickly as she had passed out, though, Amity regained
consciousness. The witch rubbed at her forehead as she slowly sat up.
“Luz? Willow? Gus? What… What happened? How did I get here? I just had
this crazy dream. It was - it was like I got transported into the Garden
of Grand Reveals, and Azura was there… but then Azura turned into Luz?
And then Luz-Azura… asked me out to Grom?”</p>
<p>Luz quickly looked to Willow and Gus for advice about what to do
here. Willow made an “are you serious right now” gesture by bringing her
palms together and pointing them at the basilisk. Gus just shrugged his
shoulders.</p>
<p>Sucking it up, Luz gently placed a hand on Amity’s shoulder. “Amity,
that wasn’t a dream.”</p>
<p>“Huh,” Amity replied oh so eloquently. “Wait… so you –”</p>
<p>“Morphed into Azura and had Gus conjure up an illusion of the Garden
so I could ask you out to Grom,” Luz finished for her. “Yeah, yeah I
did. I never got an actual answer from you, by the way.”</p>
<p>Amity slowly rose from the desk with a little help from Luz. “Wow. I
mean… It’s just… <em>wow</em>.” She gave a small laugh. “And here I
thought me wanting to ask you out to Grom would be the hardest part of
my day. You beat me to the punch, Noceda.” The witch reached into her
back pocket and withdrew a folded up note that was lavender in color.
She quietly held out the note for Luz to take. “If you want your answer,
then read this and I think you can make an educated guess.”</p>
<p>Luz grabbed the note from Amity and slowly unfolded it.</p>
<div class="gromNote"
style="background-color: #dda0dd; color: #333333; font-family: &#39;Brush Script MT&#39;, cursive; font-size: 1.5em; padding: 2.5% 5%; max-width: 33%; margin: 0 auto;">
Luz,<br> will you go<br> to Grom with me?
<center>
<ul>
<li>Amity
</center>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>Luz looked down at the note, and then back up at its author. “I’d
love to go to Grom with you, Amity.”</p>
<p>Amity let out a small laugh and sighed. “Phew, that makes me feel so
much better. Well, I guess that means the next thing I have do is pick
out an outfit for the big night.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’ll look stunning in whatever outfit you come up with,”
Luz said.</p>
<p>“That’s easy for you to say,” Amity responded. “You can just
shapeshift into whatever outfit you want at a moment’s notice.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I would just be using my natural abilities. Is that a crime or
something?” Luz asked rhetorically.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you two aren’t already girlfriends ‘or something’?”
Willow intoned.</p>
<p>Luz blew a raspberry in response, which drew a laugh from Amity.</p>
<p>“Hey, uh, hate to break up a touching moment, but we all have class
in like 5 minutes,” Gus pointed out.</p>
<p>Luz let out an exaggerated groan. “Fiiiine, I guess we can go be good
students.”</p>
<hr />
<p>For one certain basilisk, she was having trouble focusing on her
classes. She could still barely believe that everything had gone so
smoothly. (Well, except for the whole ‘Amity fainting’ thing, but that
could be brushed under the rug.) She actually had a date to Grom! Like,
for real and she wasn’t getting pranked!</p>
<p>“Miss Noceda?” A voice suddenly snapped her out of her trance.</p>
<p>Luz snapped to attention, but she still had no idea what she was
being called on for. “Sorry, can you repeat the question?”</p>
<p>“When brewing Wyvern’s Breath, what is the ratio for spider venom and
firebee honey?” Mr. Bonecrusher asked.</p>
<p>Luz paused as she thought back to the recipe book. “Uhh… Four ounces
of venom for each ounce of honey?”</p>
<p>“Got the right numbers, but backwards. The ratio should be 4:1 in the
other direction.” Bonecrusher corrected.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the bell screamed, indicating the end of the class. As Luz
began to pack up her cauldron and backpack, she was stopped when
Bonecrusher called on her again. “Miss Noceda, if you could stay for a
minute after, please.”</p>
<p>After finishing packing her bag, Luz slung it over her shoulder and
walked up to Bonecrusher’s desk. Rocking on the balls of her feet, she
opened with, “I’m guessing this is about me spacing out in class?”</p>
<p>Bonecrusher nodded. “That would be correct. You’re usually quite
attentive during lecture, and I have to say it’s a rare sight to see you
mess up a comparatively simple question. Is there anything that I need
to know about?”</p>
<p>Luz sighed. “I guess you could say so. It’s just… today I asked out a
girl to Grom and she actually said yes. Well, she didn’t actually
explicitly say yes, but she asked me out as well, so I think that
counts? I don’t exactly have a great track record when it comes to those
kinds of things, so I guess that’s why I’ve been –”</p>
<p>The teacher raised his hand, signalling for Luz to stop. “Well, in
that case I would first congratulate you on finding a Grom partner. But,
I don’t want that to interfere with your learning in my class, or any of
the other classes you’re taking. Your education is important, after
all.”</p>
<p>“Got it. I’ll be better about paying attention tomorrow,” Luz said
with a smile.</p>
<p>Luz left Bonecrusher’s classroom with the biggest of peps in her
step, her mind still buzzing with excitement. Grom was gonna be awesome!
As she walked down the hallway, she spotted her locker and made a
beeline for it.</p>
<p>Opening her locker with a quick tickle, Luz unzipped her backpack and
started swapping out her books for the next class. She couldn’t help but
smile to herself as she thought about Grom night and the inevitable
dance with Amity. Luz thought of herself as a pretty good dancer, having
watched enough of those trashy teenage princess movies from Sinsney that
she could probably pull of whatever those dance-twirly things were with
Amity.</p>
<p>As Luz reached to give Juanito the “you can close now” chin scratch,
the public announce system screeched to life, and the voice of Principal
Bump echoed through the halls. “Students of Hexside, it is now time for
the moment you have all been waiting for: the announcement of this
year’s Grom Royalty. The selection process was particularly challenging
this time round, but I have come to a conclusion. This student has shown
a mastery of their craft well beyond their years while being a model
student in all aspects, and I wouldn’t choose anyone else if given the
opportunity. This year’s Grom Royalty is… Amity Blight!”</p>
<p>Luz, Willow, Gus, and all the other students turned to look at the
named witch, hoping to get a glimpse of her reaction to the news. Amity,
for her part, dropped her backpack and sprinted down the hall and
rounded the corner.</p>
<p>“We should go check on her,” Luz said after a beat. Reaching down,
she snagged Amity’s backpack off the ground. “And get this back to
her.”</p>
<p>The trio eventually stopped outside of a bathroom when they could
hear the sound of Amity talking to herself inside. As the group entered,
Gus conjured up an illusion of an “out of order” sign hanging on the
door so that they could have some privacy.</p>
<p>“Amity?” Luz took the initiative of starting the conversation.</p>
<p>“Luz? Shouldn’t you be in class?” Amity responded, her voice coming
from behind a closed stall door.</p>
<p>“Class can wait,” Luz said. “Also, Willow and Gus are here too. But,
hey! You’re Grom Queen! Bump called you a kick-butt student! Isn’t that
something to be proud of? Not really getting ‘you should hide in the
bathroom’ vibes from what he said.”</p>
<p>Amity sighed and opened the stall door. Her hair, normally tied up in
a ponytail, hung across her face, and the sleeves of her uniform had
been rolled up past her elbow. “I know,” she said softly. “It’s just…
Grom is… a big deal. What if I’m not cut out to battle it? The last time
I was faced with a giant monstrosity was with the Slitherbeast, and you
all know how that turned out. I just froze up and you had to come in and
save my butt.”</p>
<p>Luz took a step closer and placed a hand on Amity’s shoulder. “Look,
Amity. If Bump picked you out of every single student here at Hexside,
then that means you have to be doing something right at least. And if
Bump believes in you, then I can believe in you, Willow and Gus can
believe in you, everyone can.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I know you’re going to send Grom packing,” Gus said with a
quick one-two punch combo to the air. “Fight will barely last a
minute.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be that cocky,” Willow said to Gus. “But, yeah, you’ve
got this in the bag, Amity. Grom won’t stand a chance.”</p>
<p>Amity gave a small smile. “Thanks, guys. I think we should probably
all get back to class before Bump sends the trouble guards after us for
skipping.”</p>
<p>Willow and Gus were the first to exit the bathroom, heading off to
their respective classes. Luz, meanwhile, stayed behind to help Amity
look presentable for the outside world. Grabbing a large swathe of paper
towels, Luz held them out to Amity so she could clean up the tears and
snot marks that were very un-Blight. When Luz moved to join the rest of
her friends back in their learning, Amity grabbed her arm to hold her
back.</p>
<p>“Luz, I don’t want you to do anything stupid, alright?” Amity said,
her grip tight around the basilisk’s wrist.</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘don’t do anything stupid’?” Luz asked in kind.</p>
<p>“I mean… Look, back on the Knee, you had to jump in and save my butt
from that angry slitherbeast. I caused that whole situation, though, so
I should’ve been the one to fix it. Now that I’m facing Grom though, I
don’t want you to interfere, okay? I want to… prove it to myself that
I’m not some baby who needs saving everytime I’m faced with something
dangerous.” Amity finished with a nearly-pleading look in Luz’s
direction. “Please, just let me fight my own battle on this, okay?”</p>
<p>Luz inhaled through her nose before slowly exhaling. “Deal. I won’t
interfere.”</p>
<p>Amity nodded. “Thank you, Luz. I can’t wait to enojy Grom with you.
The party, I mean. Not the battle. You stay out of that, got it?”</p>
<p>Luz laughed, “Yeah, yeah, I get it. I can’t wait for Grom
either.”</p>

<p><strong>Zorntag 2, Seventh Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>As Luz threw open the front door to the Owl House after returning
from her day at school, she wasn’t totally sure what to expect. Amity
brandishing a giant sword while Eda gave her tips on her grip was very
much not on her top 10, though. Top 300, maybe?</p>
<p>“Uhh… hi?” Luz said after a few seconds of staring at the other two
awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Hey, kiddo,” Eda said nonchalantly, all the while adjusting Amity’s
hand placement around the hilt of the sword. “Hope ya didn’t think
Blight here had gone missing while you were spreading your
multi-tracking propaganda after getting out of learning prison.” The Owl
Lady turned back to continue her lesson with Amity. “Look, if you want
to actully give Grom a solid chop, you’re gonna have to be sure that
your grip is right. Trying to hack at Fear Monster General won’t do you
good if your swings are weak.”</p>
<p>Amity nodded and readied the sword before swinging it in a downward
arc, slicing clean through a fruit that Eda was levitating. Letting the
now-halved fruit fall to the ground, Eda smiled and gave Amity a pat on
the back. “Good on ya, Blight. You’re a natural at this.”</p>
<p>Luz was still somehwat confused as to why this was even happening in
the first place. “Eda… umm… why does Amity have a sword? She has magic,
and I think that’s way more dangerous to Grom than simply cutting it
up.”</p>
<p>“I thought that too, kiddo,” Eda answered. “But you’ve gotta remember
that magic is tied to emotion. If Amity is all spooked by Grom, then
that’ll muck up whatever attempts she’ll try at magic. Cold steel,
though, doesn’t give a hoot about your emotions and just cuts whatever
you swing it at. So even if Mittens is scared out of her socks, she’ll
still have a weapon she can fall back on.”</p>
<p>Luz nodded. “Ohhh. That nakes a lot of sense, actually.”</p>
<p>Eda grinned. “Yeah, I’m not gonna let my kid’s date die if I can have
a say in it.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Luz was struck by an idea. “Hey, Amity?”</p>
<p>Amity perked up at hearing Luz call her name. “Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Well, I just had a brain thought from my noggin.” Luz explained.
“Grom is all about scaring you, yeah? Well, what if when Grom tries to
turn into whatever spooks you, you aren’t spooked?”</p>
<p>Amity paused as she thought that over. “Huh, that <em>could</em>
help, but how would I be able to face the manifestations of my –” She
stopped when she saw Luz’s blank look. “Right, basilisk, shapeshifting.
Well, I guess it wouldn’t hurt. You just have to promise to not make fun
of my fears, all right?”</p>
<p>Luz nodded. “Your fears will be safe with me.”</p>
<hr />
<p>“Come on, Amity!” Luz shouted. “If Grom is gonna turn into your worst
fear, than you’re gonna have to punch that fear <em>in the
face</em>!”</p>
<p>In the front lawn of the Owl House, Luz and Amity were going through
what the basilisk lovingly referred to as “fear fighting bootcamp”. Luz
was using her shapeshifting to turn into nightmarish forms of all of
Amity’s fears. Well, the ones that had physical form, anyway. It wasn’t
like Luz could exactly morph into “the crushing anxiety that I’ll never
meet my mother’s expectations.”</p>
<p>Currently, Luz was in the form of a monstrous zombie-like entity. Her
skin was an unnatural bright red, and her eyes were ringed in a pitch
black. Holes peppered her flesh, at some points being entirely missing,
revealing the black bones underneath the skin and muscle and tissue. Luz
could totally see why this creature had haunted young Amity’s
dreams.</p>
<p>“Luz, I still don’t want to punch you in the face with an Abomination
gauntlet,” Amity said plainly.</p>
<p>“I can just heal up in, like, three seconds,” Luz countered. “Come
on, you’ve been stalling for 10 minutes now. Just punch me in the face.
I’m Grom, and I’m gonna get ya!”</p>
<p>Amity took a deep breath. “Are you totally sure that I won’t hurt
you?”</p>
<p>Luz nodded, “Positive. Now punch me already.”</p>
<p>The abomination witch sighed and cocked back her fist, Abomination
goop gathering around it before solidifying into a gauntlet. As her fist
rocketed forward, Luz decided to play up Amity’s strength. When gauntlet
met seemingly-rotting flesh, the basilisk stumbled backward and fell to
a knee.</p>
<p>Luz looked up and met Amity’s eye. “See how easy that was? Now you’ve
just got to do that to the actual Grom like 5 times or whatever.”</p>
<p>Amity, still hesitant, lowered her gauntlet-clad fist. “I know you
say you’ll be fine, but I can’t help but worry. What if I actually hurt
you?”</p>
<p>Luz, noting Amity’s distress, quickly morphed back into her human
form, a warm smile gracing her features. Walking over to the despondent
witch, she gently placed a hand on her shoulder. “Hey, it’s okay to be
worried. Fighting Grom is a big deal, yeah, but you gotta remember that
you’re not alone in this. You’ve got me, Willow, Gus, Eda, King, Ed and
Em – heck even Bump! – Everybody’s backing you up. And personally, I’m
not gonna let my first real date-dance-thing get ruined by some cut-rate
horror movie monster.”</p>
<p>Amity laughed at Luz’s joke, but her smile dropped after a few
seconds. “I know that, but what if I freeze up again?”</p>
<p>Luz sidled up to Amity and draped an arm over her shoulder. “Well, if
you’re Grom Queen, then that means I’m Grom… Consort or something, and
it’s my job to protect you if poo hits the fan.”</p>
<p>Amity smirked and snuck out from under Luz’s grasp before turning to
face the basilisk. “I’m not sure that’s a real title, but if it’ll help
you feel better than you can be my Grom Consort.”</p>
<p>After a few seconds of silence in which the two simply enjoyed the
silence, Luz spoke up. “Do you think we should call it for fear training
today?”</p>
<p>Amity simply nodded. Taking that as her sign to head back in, Luz
went upstairs to check on what King and Eda were doing. Luz knew they
were doing something in the Owl Lady’s bedroom, but she couldn’t make
out much more than that from what little she could see going on through
the giant stained-glass window.</p>
<p>“Hey, guys!” Luz said as she entered the room. Eda was standing on
top of a stool, and she wore a patched-up brown suit. Honestly, it
wasn’t a bad look. King, for his part, was dressed as a ferocious little
fashionista.</p>
<p>“Sup, kiddo. Fear training go good?” Eda asked, moving her arm so
King could check the stitching of the elbow patch.</p>
<p>“It went… alright? I think?” Luz answered slowly, not really sure of
the answer.</p>
<p>“Well, if it’ll calm your nerves, just know that I’m gonna be at the
shindig, too,” Eda supplied. “Bumpy-poo ‘offered’ me to chaperone.”</p>
<p>“He blackmailed you, didn’t he?” Luz said with a cocked eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I won’t say he did blackmail me, but I’m not saying he didn’t,” Eda
replied.</p>
<p>King laughed. “Do you wanna know the blackmail?” he questioned
Luz.</p>
<p>Luz gave a devious chuckle. “Ooh, gimme the Eda backstory.”</p>
<p>King hopped down from Eda’s arm and scampered over right up to Luz’s
ear. As he whispered, Luz couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “No
way. Eda did that?!”</p>
<p>The tiny demon nodded. “Yeah! I know, right?”</p>
<p>Eda, not going to let her bad girl reputation be tarnished, loudly
cleared her throat to draw attention. “Luz, if you’re gonna be going out
with the Grom Queen, you’re going to have to look the part as well. Do
you have any idea on what you’re gonna wear?”</p>
<p>Luz perked up at the mention of her outfit of choice. “Ooh, yeah,
I’ve actually got this fun idea. So it’s basically going to be like a
dress-suit hybrid outfit thingy. So, like a blazer and tie and stuff up
top, but then a skirt or tutu or something down low.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm…” Eda thought on what that would look like. “You got a picture
or something that I could look at? Kinda struggling to picture it in my
mind’s eye.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you asked,” Luz said coyly, before she morphed into the
outfit right then and there. “So… what do you think?” She gave a quick
twirl so that Eda could see it from all the angles. When she was back
facing Eda, she batted her eyelashes to up the cuteness. “Do you think
Amity’s gonna like it?”</p>
<p>Eda gave a breathy laugh. “Amity’s gonna love it, kiddo.”</p>
