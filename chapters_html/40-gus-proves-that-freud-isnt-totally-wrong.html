Proves That Freud Isn’t Totally Wrong</h1>
<p><strong>Kriegstag 4, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Eda nervously drummed her fingers against her kneecap. Amity, Goops,
and Plant Girl had been in Luz’s mind for nearly half an hour now, and
the Owl Lady was starting to get anxious. She took a small sip of her
apple blood. Maybe that would help with her nerves.</p>
<p>It didn’t.</p>
<p>Sighing, Eda walked over to Luz and adjusted the blanket, pulling it
to cover up to the basilisk’s shoulders. Hopefully Luz being comfy would
help with the brain fires. (It probably didn’t work like that, but Eda
was running out of ways to keep herself busy that didn’t involve
mindlessly scrolling Penstagram or nervously detaching and reattaching
her limbs.)</p>
<p>King was similarly not doing the best. He had situated himself on the
floor near where Luz’s tail draped off the couch. The King of Demons was
trying to keep himself occupied. Scratching at his neck probably wasn’t
the healthiest coping mechanism, but he couldn’t stop himself. His best
friend’s brain was on fire, and here he was just sitting around.</p>
<p>“Are we sure Luz is going to be alright?” King asked.</p>
<p>“She’s going to be just fine, King. Her friends aren’t going to let
anything bad happen in there. We just need to have a little faith in
them, alright?” While she was mainly trying to calm King down, Eda had
to admit that it was also partly for her own sanity. She needed Luz to
make it through this. She didn’t know what she would do if Luz didn’t
make it out alright.</p>
<p>“We just need to have a little faith,” she repeated. Until the bell
rang, that was all they could do.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Tuesday, June 29, 2021 | The Mindscape of Luz
Noceda</strong></p>
<p>As Amity entered into the dreaded Knee memory, she fully prepared
herself to be face to face with her own blushing visage. If that
happened, she was going to turn right around and walk out of the memory.
Then she would probably go torch her own memories, just to make doubly
sure that neither she nor Luz ever had any recollection of The
Blush.</p>
<p>Okay maybe that was a stupid plan, but she didn’t have any better
ideas.</p>
<p>Looking around, Amity saw the memory’s version of her. Thankfully, it
was blush free. Letting out a sigh of relief, Amity relaxed
slightly.</p>
<p>“Since you were actually here for this, you’ll probably know more of
what to look for. Anything look out of place?” Willow said, looking
around at the scenic view from atop the Knee. It was a very pretty
sight, all things considered.</p>
<p>The moment the memory had paused one was one that Amity could vividly
remember. Luz had just gotten out of that giant snowbank after searching
for that stupid, cute flower. The basilisk was absolutely covered in
snow, but she had a giant smile on her face in spite of the cold. Amity
couldn’t deny it: Luz looked cute in that moment. (And lots of other
moments, but that was irrelevant.) The memory’s version of Amity was
standing by Eda, Edric, and Emira, watching on as Luz held aloft the
fruits of her search.</p>
<p>However, Luz’s hands were noticeably empty.</p>
<p>Amity groaned. Of course it was that darn flower. Why wouldn’t it be
the thing that needed to be fixed? Maybe the fates had it out for her.
Just inflict even more torture on her, why don’t they?</p>
<p>Trudging through the snowbank where Luz had been searching, Amity saw
the flower sticking out of the side of the bank. Gently picking up the
flower, careful not to damage it, she cradled it against her chest.
Slowly, she walked over to the memory version of Luz.</p>
<p><em>Titan, this feels weird,</em> she thought. This memory needed to
be fixed, though, as much as it pained Amity to admit. Even if it meant
Willow would bear witness to The Blush.</p>
<p>Inserting the flower into Memory Luz’s waiting hand, Amity watched as
color returned to the moment. There was no going back now.</p>
<p>The memory began playing, and Memory Luz ran over, flower in
hand.</p>
<p>“Luz, you didn’t need to go through all of that trouble just to get
that silly little flower,” Memory Amity said as the snow-covered
basilisk approached.</p>
<p>“But I wanted to! You deserve the flower,” Luz replied as she came to
a stop. Brushing Memory Amity’s hair out of the way, Luz gently tucked
the flower behind the witch’s ear.</p>
<p>“See? You look perfect now! The flower really ties the whole outfit
together,” Luz said with a smile.</p>
<p>The real Amity did her best to not turn and run. Right there, for
Willow to see, was Memory Amity’s giant blushing face.</p>
<p>When the memory began looping, Amity tried to hightail it out of
there. “Alright, we did it. The memory’s fixed. Let’s get out of
here.”</p>
<p>Willow held out an arm, grabbing Amity’s wrist. “Not so fast.”</p>
<p>Amity tried to force her way out of Willow’s grasp, but the plant
witch held tight. “Let me go!”</p>
<p>“I’ll let you go if you answer my question,” Willow said.</p>
<p>Amity drooped. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“Do you like Luz?” Willow asked plainly.</p>
<p>“I mean, of course I like Luz. She’s my friend,” Amity responded,
doing her best to dodge the question.</p>
<p>Willow rolled her eyes and scoffed. “Don’t play coy with me, Amity.
You know what I mean.”</p>
<p>Amity exhaled sharply and stared down at the floor. “Yeah, I like
Luz.”</p>
<p>“In the ‘more than friends’ way?” Willow continued.</p>
<p>Amity just nodded.</p>
<p>Willow released her grip on the abomination witch’s arm. “That’s what
I thought. Do you have any idea if Luz feels the same way?”</p>
<p>Amity threw her arms up in defeat. “I don’t know. Maybe? She was
being all weird and… flirty back in photo class. You saw what she was
like. All mushy and sweet. Does having your memories burned up change
your personality or something?”</p>
<p>Willow tried her best to remember what the teacher had said about
memory magic. “I don’t think it would. It might make the feelings more
exaggerated, though.”</p>
<p>“So do you think that means Luz might actually ‘like’ like me?” Amity
said hopefully.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Willow replied. “Grom is coming up pretty soon, ya
know.”</p>
<p>“Do you think Luz would even want to go to Grom with me?” Amity
questioned.</p>
<p>“You’ll never know if you never try,” Willow replied.</p>
<p>Amity sighed. “You’re right. I’ll give it a try. Maybe. No
guarantees.”</p>
<p>“Good. Now that that’s been handled, I think we should get going,”
Willow suggested. “I don’t think there’s any more memories for us to
repair. Do you think we should try to meet up with Gus and Inner
Luz?”</p>
<p>Amity nodded. “Yeah. Let’s just hope that Gus hasn’t been sidetracked
by human stuff too much.”</p>
<p>Willow laughed and gave Amiy a look. “This is Gus we’re talking about
here. Would he ever pass up an opportunity to learn about humans? Now
come on, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Taking one last look back at the memory of The Blush, Amity took
Willow’s offered hand and hoisted herself out of the memory. With all of
the Demon Realm memories fixed up, it was time to check up on the other
team.</p>
<hr />
<p>Gus was having the time of his life fixing up Luz’s memories from the
Human Realm. Sure, the whole “Luz might never be herself again if we
don’t fix all the memories” thing was a harrowing thought, but still.
Inner Luz had been a great help, which was nice. She always had a good
idea of what needed to be fixed.</p>
<p>(There was one odd thing that stood out to Gus about the Inner Luz’s
form, though. Whenever he and the Inner Luz would be inside of a Human
Realm memory, Inner Luz would always end up taking on Luz’s human form,
and it would stay that way the entire time they were in the memory.
However, the second they left the memory Inner Luz would return to her
identity crisis-fueled random shapeshifting. Gus didn’t want to bring it
up. It seemed like something that Luz would want to keep private.)</p>
<p>Through the two’s exploration of the mindscape, Gus had learned that
a lot of his ideas about human culture were… misguided. Apparently, a
“microwave” had nothing to do with the ocean, but was actually a device
used to heat food. (Why it was called a microwave, then, Gus wasn’t
sure. Inner Luz had mentioned electric magnets or something as the
reason behind the name.)</p>
<p>Climbing out of a memory that had featured Luz and her father playing
a game called “baseball”, Gus set his sights on the next memory in need
of repairs. Looking around, most of the memories he saw were either ones
that had already been fixed or weren’t touched by the fires in the first
place. Approaching a fork in the path, the illusionist looked to the
Inner Luz.</p>
<p>“Should we split for a bit? I take one path, you take the other. We’d
find broken memories faster,” Gus suggested.</p>
<p>“That’s fine by me,” the Inner Luz responded. “Let me know if you
find any locked up memories though. I have to deal with those ones
myself.”</p>
<p>“You got it,” Gus said with a nod. “So which path do you wanna
take?”</p>
<p>Inner Luz shrugged her shoulders, “Left one, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Got it. I’ll let you know if I find anything,” Gus said as he began
walking down the right-hand branch.</p>
<p>Clicking his tongue thrice, the illusionist looked for any memories
that needed fixing. It looked as if most of the memories were safe from
the fires, though, so this was probably going to be a quick search. In
that case, it probably wouldn’t hurt if he did a little recreational
memory watching.</p>
<p>Finding an interesting looking memory to spectate on wasn’t too hard,
since all of them were interesting! Picking a painting that showed Luz
sitting in a classroom, Gus popped in to see what human schools were
like.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>September 27, 2018 | Terrace Middle School | Hirsch,
Maryland</strong></p>
<p>“Can anybody tell me what the difference between an animal with an
endoskeleton and an exoskeleton is?” Mr. Stevenson asked, looking out
over the classroom of middle schoolers who were bored out of their
minds. Well, all except for one.</p>
<p>Luz’s hand shot up into the air. She knew this one. She knew this
one! She waved her arm back and forth, hoping to draw the teacher’s
attention.</p>
<p>“Luz, what do you think?” Mr. Stevenson eventually called her
name.</p>
<p>“An animal with an endoskeleton has all its bones on the inside of
their body, but an animal with an exoskeleton has its bones on the
outside like a suit of armor,” she answered confidently.</p>
<p>“Correct,” the teacher replied, to which Luz gave a small victory
fist pump. “And can you name an example of each type?”</p>
<p>That was another easy one, Luz thought. “Well, us humans have our
skeletons on the inside, so we have endoskeletons. For exoskeleton? Uhh…
spiders?”</p>
<p>From behind her, somebody faked a cough. “<em>Nerd!</em>” they said
through clenched fist.</p>
<p>“Would you like to repeat that for the class, Michelle?”
Mr. Stevenson asked, looking at the brunette seated behind Luz.</p>
<p>“No, Mr. Stephenson.” Michelle responded in her normal voice.</p>
<p>“Good, because I don’t want to hear that kind of disparaging talk in
this classroom. Now, let’s continue with the lesson. Animals with
exoskeletons can be divided into a few main categories. First we have
the…”</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Tuesday, June 29, 2021 | The Mindscape of Luz
Noceda</strong></p>
<p>Gus’ feelings on that last memory were conflicted to say the least.
While it was good that the teacher had stood up for his student, the
fact that the other students had been mean to Luz was disheartening. Luz
was awesome! How anyone could want to be mean to her was a mystery.</p>
<p>Looking around for another memory to adventure into before returning
to fixing the broken ones, Gus saw another one of Luz in a human school,
as evidenced by the lockers he could spot in the background of the
painting. This one showed her in the library, though, which made Gus
pause. Did human schools actually have libraries built into them? That
was a novel concept to the witch. Hopping into the painting, Gus watched
the next memory as it played out before him.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>October 29, 2020 | Gravesfield Middle School | Gravesfield,
Connecticut</strong></p>
<p>Luz slowly nudged the door to the GMS library open. While she was
supposed to be eating her lunch in the school cafeteria, that place was
always too loud and hectic for her. The library, on the other hand, was
a quiet, relaxing place where she could eat her lunch in peace. It
especially helped that Mr. Grine, the librarian, was willing to turn a
blind eye to Luz’s skirting of the lunchtime rules.</p>
<p>After waving to Mr. Grin and offering a quick “Hello!”, she found her
normal spot for eating lunch. Between the science fiction and the
fantasy sections, there was a gap in the bookshelves that was the
perfect size for Luz to sit in. Placing her backpack down on the ground,
she popped a squat in her little nook. Pulling her lunch out, she slowly
began eating the sandwich that Mama had packed for her.</p>
<p>(Mr. Grine was willing to let Luz eat her lunch here as long as she
didn’t make a mess, so she was always careful to not spill any crumbs.
Early on she learned that a paper bag that had been ripped open down the
side and flattened out could serve as a great crumb catcher.)</p>
<p>If she was being honest with herself, this was probably her favorite
spot in the entire school. The serenity she felt when she could just
relax here and skim the book catalog was unmatched. Everywhere else
either had too many people, was too loud, or was both.</p>
<p>When she finished her lunch, she crumpled up the paper bag and tossed
it in a nearby trash can. Now was time for the main event: picking out
all the books she was gonna check out!</p>
<p>Starting in the fantasy section, she looked over her choices. Ooh,
was that a new <em>Changelings</em> book? She snatched that one up. A
<em>Werewolves of Wimbledon</em> novel adaptation? Added. A copy of
<em>Slaying Dragons in Three Easy Steps</em>? That one looks fun.</p>
<p>Moving on to the sci-fi section, she picked out a few books that
looked mildly interesting. They were just going to be backup reading
material if she ran out of the good stuff over the weekend. (Knowing
herself, that would probably end up happening.)</p>
<p>Her reading selections for the next fortnight ready, Luz approached
the checkout desk.</p>
<p>“What are ya drawing today?” Luz asked as she placed her stack of
books on the desk. Mr. Grine was always fond of doodling the craziest
things when he had spare time.</p>
<p>The librarian turned his sketch pad around so that Luz could see the
masterpiece in progress. “It’s a grizzly bear, in the middle of the
White House, and she’s mopping the carpet with the help of her little
hawk buddy,” Grine described the scene.</p>
<p>Luz giggled. “That’s a cute grizzly. Very ferocious looking.”</p>
<p>Mr. Grine did a mock bow. “Why thank you.” He then looked at the
books that Luz had placed on the counter. “So, are these all for the
next two weeks?”</p>
<p>“Yup!” Luz replied with a nod.</p>
<p>Grine frowned and ran his pointer finger down the stack of books.
“Hmm. It seems like there’s something missing.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Luz was more than a little confused.</p>
<p>Reaching under his desk, the librarian pulled a book out and placed
it on top of the stack. “There we go. Now you’re ready to check
out.”</p>
<p>Grabbing the new book, Luz looked at the cover. She couldn’t believe
her eyes. “<em>The Good Witch Azura: The Sunken City</em>! No way!”</p>
<p>Grine smiled. “We got that in stock just yesterday. I knew that
somebody would want to read it, so I held a copy for you.”</p>
<p>Luz beamed. “Thank you!”</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Tuesday, June 29, 2021 | The Mindscape of Luz
Noceda</strong></p>
<p>Gus couldn’t help but smile. That was a fun memory. Rolling his
shoulders and cracking his knuckles, he put on his serious face. That
was enough fun Luz memory shenanigans. He had to keep looking for
memories to repair. (Even if he wanted to just stay in here for a few
more hours while he explored all the memories, needing repairs or
otherwise.)</p>
<p>Continuing on down the path, he passed memory after memory, all of
them calling out to him. <em>Come explore, Gus!</em> they were saying,
but he resisted the urge.Eventually, he stumbled across a memory that
was very much not like the others. This one didn’t just have a burnt up
painting, but the tree itself seemed to be dying.</p>
<p>Approaching the dilapidated memory, Gus noticed that the painting had
been chained up. Key word: had. Now, though, the molten remains of the
chains lay pooled up on the ground in front of the memory tree. Now with
the memory unobscured, Gus could clearly see that it depicted a younger
Luz who looked to be hiding in a bathroom stall. Looking around, Gus saw
no sign of the Inner Luz. She did say that she wanted to be the one to
deal with the locked up memories. However, she’d done so much that Gus
thought he could probably fix this one by himself. How hard could it
be?</p>
<p>Stepping into the memory, Gus took in his surroundings. The “freeze
frame” that the memory had paused on wasn’t a pretty one. Memory Luz was
sitting on the toilet, legs pulled up to her chest while her head was
buried into her knee. The scene felt all too familiar to Gus. Taking a
deep breath, the illusionist looked for what was wrong with the
memory.</p>
<p>Hmm… Maybe there was something wrong with the – “Hey! What are you
doing in here? I told you to leave these to me!” Inner Luz shouted at
Gus.</p>
<p>The witch jolted back in surprise, ramming his shoulder into the
toilet paper holder. Hissing in pain, he turned around to see a very
angry looking Inner Luz glaring daggers at him.</p>
<p>“Get out right now,” Inner Luz said in a low voice. “This memory is
off limits.”</p>
<p>“What? Why? This one seems like an easy fix,” Gus argued in his
defense, trying to work some feeling back into his shoulder.</p>
<p>“‘Why?’ I’ll tell you why: if this memory ever sees the light of day,
then Luz will never be the same,” the Inner Luz explained. “I locked
this memory up for Luz’s own safety.”</p>
<p>“What could be so bad about this memory?” Gus inquired. “I can
remember at least three, no, four separate occasions of me crying in the
bathroom.”</p>
<p>“Take a closer look at her eyes,” Inner Luz instructed.</p>
<p>Getting down on one knee, Gus positioned himself so that he could see
Luz’s face, even though the majority of it was obscured by her hair
draping over her features. Looking up, the young girl’s eyes were very
clearly not human. The normally white sclera were now black, and her
irises were yellow instead of their usual golden brown.</p>
<p>“That’s why I had to lock down this memory,” Inner Luz said as Gus
got back to his feet. “How would she explain it to herself if she
remembered her eyes looking like that?”</p>
<p>Gus struggled to find the proper words to express how he was feeling.
“But – You can’t – That’s just – Gah! You realize how stupid that is,
right?”</p>
<p>Inner Luz blinked, confused by what Gus was trying to get at. “What
do you mean?”</p>
<p>Gus exhaled sharply. “How would you stopping Luz from remembering
this protect her? She knows she’s a basilisk now, so you blanking out
her memory won’t do her any good. Heck, it would probably do her more
harm than good to have her not remember a memory like this.”</p>
<p>“Oh. I didn’t think about that,” the Inner Luz admitted.</p>
<p>“Does that mean you’ll leave this memory unlocked or whatever?” Gus
asked.</p>
<p>“I will,” Inner Luz said with a curt nod.</p>
<p>“In that case, would you help me fix this memory? I can’t tell what’s
wrong.” Gus said hopefully.</p>
<p>The Inner Luz looked around the scene before her. Then she spotted
the flaw. “See that lock on the stall door? Flip it so the door is
locked. Young me wanted her privacy.”</p>
<p>With a flip of the dial, color rushed back into the memory.</p>
<p>The younger Luz then began sniffling. Pulling out her phone, the girl
then opened the front-facing camera. When the screen loaded and it
showed her face, she let out a small scream and dropped the phone onto
the tiled floor below.</p>
<p>Slowly reaching down, she picked her phone back up. Taking another
look at her face, she blinked fervently, as if blinking enough would
suddenly make her eyes go back to normal.</p>
<p>Nothing had changed, to the young girl’s dismay. Her eyes were still
those demonic yellow and black.</p>
<p>Slamming her eyes shut, she started whispering to herself. “When I
count to 10 I’ll be a normal girl. When I count to 10 I’ll be a normal
girl. When I count to 10 I’ll be a normal girl.”</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, she slowly started counting to herself. “1… 2…
3… 4… 5…6… 7… 8… 9… 10.”</p>
<p>Opening her eyes, she found that they had finally returned to their
normal golden brown. Letting out a sigh of relief, Luz sat motionless on
the closed toilet seat for a few seconds. Then, she wiped the tears from
her eyes and blew her nose on a wad of toilet paper. Putting on a brave
face, she was finally ready to face the outside world.</p>
<p>When the scene began looping, Gus and the Inner Luz took that as
their cure to investigate other memories. Try as they might, though,
they couldn’t find any other memories that needed to be repaired. Maybe
they had actually gotten all of them? After a third loop of walking by
the same memory of Luz competing in a pie-eating contest, the two
decided that they were ready to call it.</p>
<p>“You know, it would be really helpful if you had some sort of magical
mind tracking ability so we knew where the others are,” Gus said. “Can
you do that?”</p>
<p>“Nope,” Inner Luz replied, popping the p.</p>
<p>“Really?” Gus was taken by surprise by that. “You’re the Guardian of
Luz’s Minsdcape, and you don’t have the ability to track whoever is in
here? I find that hard to believe.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well believe it. We’ve gotta find Amity and Willow the old
fashioned way.” Inner Luzlooked at the memories around here. “Okay,
based on the state fair memory being to our right, then that would mean
Willow and Amity are probably somewhere in that direction.” She pointed
forward and to the left. The pair headed that way for the next few
minutes, and then they heard it.</p>
<p>“Gus! Hey! Gus! Over here!” Looking around, the illusionist finally
located where the voice was coming from. About a dozen or so trees away,
Amity and Willow were waving their arms to catch the other group’s
attention.</p>
<p>Jogging over to his friends, Gus reconvened with the duo. Behind him,
the Inner Luz slowly meandered in the same direction, deliberately
taking her time and stopping to look in random memories.</p>
<p>“So, how was it fixing the Demon Realm memories?” Gus inquired once
he caught up with the others.</p>
<p>Amity was the first to answer. “It was… okay, I guess. Most of the
memories were pretty easy to fix since we’d been there for them to
happen.”</p>
<p>Willow then added her piece. “Yeah, I thought it wasn’t that bad.
Though, some of Luz’s memories were just flat out wrong. Like, when we
tried to do the moonlight conjuring, she remembered me summoning the
wrong type of flower.”</p>
<p>Gus raised an eyebrow. “Huh, that’s weird. I don’t think there were
any wrong memories for the Human Realm side of things. None that Inner
Luz pointed out, anyway. I did help her with some repressed memories,
though, so that was a fun bonus to fixing the regular damaged memories.
Plus, ya know, learning about humans!”</p>
<p>Amity laughed at her friend’s enthusiasm. “Of course you found a way
to make this about humans. How many memories did you look at even though
they didn’t need fixing?”</p>
<p>“I just took the opportunity when it presented itself,” Gus defended
his “learning about humans” detours. “And it was only seven memories,
for your information.”</p>
<p>“Dang it,” Amity hissed. Reaching into her pocket, she pulled out her
wallet and handed a 10 snail bill over to Willow. The plant witch
pocketed the cash with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Hey, Gus?” the Inner Luz said, pulling him aside for a private
conversation, finally having made it over to the trio.</p>
<p>“Yeah, what’s up?” the illusionist responded.</p>
<p>“I just want to say thank you. I got so caught up in protecting Luz
from the memories of her accidentally using her powers that I forgot
that she knows about them now. It felt good to unlock the memories. Plus
that means I don’t have to worry about the locks falling off anymore,”
she said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Eh it’s no biggie,” Gus replied, brushing off the thanks with a hand
wave. “I’m sure Luz would’ve done the same for me if I had any repressed
memories.”</p>
<p>Then he thought about what he said. “Well, I don’t think I have any
repressed memories, anyway.”</p>
<p>(Sure, he did have the constant fear in the back of his mind of
losing control of his magic like he’d done years prior, or meeting a
similar fate to his mother and leaving his father all alone, but those
totally didn’t bother him. Totally.)</p>
<p>With their brief sidebar finished, Gus and Inner Luz returned to the
rest of the group. “So, are you guys ready to head back to the realm of
the living?” Inner Luz asked.</p>
<p>Amity looked to Willow and Gus. Willow gave a nod, while Gus flashed
a thumbs up. “We’re ready. Thanks for all your help.”</p>
<p>Inner Luz smiled and fired finger guns at the trio. “Right back at
ya.”</p>
<p>Pulling out the bell that Eda had given her, Amity gave it a few loud
rings. Hopefully Eda was within earshot. (Maybe the bell was magic and
Eda would hear it no matter where she was? That was always a
possibility.)</p>
<p>After a few seconds of waiting, a bubble of light encircled the trio
and started to collapse in on itself. Before Amity was fully shrunken
down by the bubble, though, she saw Inner Luz waving goodbye to
them.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Kriegstag 4, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Eda concentrated on the spell. To her immense relief, the bubble
drifted out of Luz’s ear and popped, dropping the three kids inside of
it unceremoniously on the ground.</p>
<p>Walking over, Eda helped the kids get back to their feet. “You better
tell me that you fixed every single damaged memory in Luz’s brain.”</p>
<p>“Each and every one of them,” Willow said happily.</p>
<p>“I even helped her unlock some repressed ones from her childhood!”
Gus added.</p>
<p>That caught Eda by surprise. It was a good surprise, though. “Huh.
Well thanks for that, Goops.”</p>
<p>“My name is Gus,” the illusionist corrected.</p>
<p>“I know,” the Owl Lady replied. “Just giving ya a hard time.”</p>
<p>Groaning, Luz rubbed at her forehead. It felt like somebody had just
taken a sledgehammer to the inside of her skull and was wailing on it
full force. Rubbing at her eyes, she saw that she was in the living room
of the Owl House, laying down on the couch. A hand was laid down on her
shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hey there, sleepyhead. How are ya feeling?” Eda asked her.</p>
<p>Weakly lifting her head to make eye contact with the Owl Lady, Luz
gave a noncommittal, “I’ve certainly been better.”</p>
<p>King rushed over and jumped onto Luz’s stomach, wrapping his paws
around her as best he could. “You’re alright! I mean - I knew you’d make
it. Never had a doubt about it for a second. Totally didn’t worry at
all.”</p>
<p>Luz softly laughed and rubbed at the tiny demon’s skull. “Thanks,
buddy.”</p>
<p>Yawning, Luz stretched her arms out. “Man, how long was I out
for?”</p>
<p>Eda looked down at her watch. “22 minutes and 39 seconds. Not that I
was counting or anything.”</p>
<p>That drew a small laugh from Luz. “You don’t have to be that
specific. It’s almost like… you care about me. But that’s a silly idea.
You’re the grouchy old Owl Lady.”</p>
<p>“I see you’re doing well enough to sass me,” Eda said.</p>
<p>Luz simply smiled. Sitting up, she did a few small stretches to work
some feeling back into her, well, back.</p>
<p>“Do you remember my name?” another voice asked Luz.</p>
<p>Looking at the other occupants in the room, Luz saw an elf-looking
person standing off to the side. “Uhh… Tatiana?” Then after a beat she
gave her real answer. “Nah, I’m just messing. How could I forget you,
Willow?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Luz is back, everybody!” Willow gave a cheer and wrapped Luz in
a hug.</p>
<p>The hug was too tight, though, based on Luz’s pained expression.
“NEED. TO. BREATHE.”</p>
<p>“Oh, hehe. Sorry. Just got a little excited,” Willow apologized,
breaking off the hug.</p>
<p>“Man, that was a heck of an adventure,” Gus said. “I wanna do that
again. Without the memory burning, of course.”</p>
<p>Luz chuckled at her friend’s enthusiasm. “I’m feeling like I missed
out on a fun moment. What did the insides of my brain look like, by the
way?”</p>
<p>Willow was the one to answer. “It was like a giant forest, but all of
the trees had paintings inside the bark. You could actually enter into
the memory through the painting. That’s how we fixed the damaged
memories, too.”</p>
<p>Luz nodded. “Huh, sounds fun.”</p>
<p>Luz noticed that one person had remained suspiciously silent during
the conversation. A certain emerald-haired witch was trying to sneak out
of the house unnoticed. “What about you, Amity? Any wacky crazy
shenanigans go down in my brain?”</p>
<p>Amity stopped dead in her tracks and slowly turned to face the
basilisk. “Nope, not really.”</p>
<p>Luz took a deep breath. “Hmm… okay. Oh! Wait, before you go! Look,
I’m not sure why exactly you torched my brain, but thanks for doing
that. I learned some things about myself that my brain had been hiding
from me.”</p>
<p>That seemed to catch Amity off guard. “You’re welcome?” The
abomination witch then summoned her scroll and looked at something.
“Well, I’m gonna have to go. Mother needs me for our latest shareholder
presentation, and I can’t risk being late again.”</p>
<p>Luz smiled. “Alright, have fun!”</p>
<p>Amity matched with a smile in return, albeit weaker. “I’ll try.”</p>
<p>Willow was the next to speak. “I should probably head out, too. Have
some botany homework I need to work on.”</p>
<p>Luz fired finger guns in Willow’s direction. “Cool beans.” Turning to
the last of her Hexside friend group, she looked to Gus. “I’m guessing
you’ve got to leave as well?”</p>
<p>Gus nodded. “Yeah. Dad’s probably wondering where I am since school
ended hours ago.”</p>
<p>Luz nodded. “Alrighty. See you tomorrow!”</p>
<p>“You know it. Meet up by your locker?” Gus asked.</p>
<p>“Sounds good,” the basilisk replied, waving goodbye to the
illusionist as he closed the front door.</p>
<p>With that, the only people left in the house were Eda, King, and Luz.
(Hooty was technically outside, so he wasn’t counted.)</p>
<p>Collapsing back into the couch, Luz took a few deep breaths. She
still had a pounding headache, and she only needed one guess to figure
out why. Readjusting the pillow that had been tucked under her head
minutes before, Luz kicked her feet up onto the armrest at the other end
of the couch and laid her hands across her stomach. She probably wasn’t
going to move from this spot for a while.</p>
<p>One question lingered in the back of Luz’s mind as she relaxed on the
couch. “Hey, Eda?”</p>
<p>The Owl Lady perked up at the mention of her name. “Yeah, kiddo?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if this is something my brain made up because it was on
fire or whatever, but did you call me your daughter earlier?” Luz asked.
There were a couple things that the basilisk thought she remembered
happening, but she wasn’t totally sure. (Another memory that Luz could
recall was her flirting with Amity, but that one was definitely
fake.)</p>
<p>Nearly on instinct, Eda started to cast a sleep spell on Luz, but she
canceled it before it was completed. She couldn’t just put <del>her
daughter</del> <del>her apprentice</del> Luz to sleep every time the
question of “What exactly is our relationship?” came up. Eventually she
would have to tackle the issue head on, and now was probably a better
time than ever. Letting it fester would probably just lead to more
weirdness between the two.</p>
<p>Exhaling sharply, Eda nodded. “Yeah, I did. I care about you, kiddo.
I care about you a lot. When your buddies carried you in here, I damn
near lost it.”</p>
<p>Luz sat up on the couch. She had a feeling this was going
somewhere.</p>
<p>Eda shuddered. “I don’t want to get all mopey and sad on you, but
when I first started living on my own, I didn’t have anybody. It was
just me and the curse. Lily was constantly trying to arrest me. Mom was
trying whatever scammy cure she’d concocted for the week. And my dad,
he… uh… I don’t think he’ll ever wanna see me again.”</p>
<p>Then, the Owl Lady smiled. “But then I found King, and eventually
you, and I guess my brain just decided to label you as Kid One and Kid
Two. Then you called me Mama when we were cooking that
<em>sancocho</em>, and I think that was what made my brain latch onto
the idea that you were now really my kid.”</p>
<p>“Oh, wow,” Luz was caught off guard by Eda’s admission. “I didn’t
know you thought about me like that.”</p>
<p>Eda laughed. “Well I didn’t either, really. It just sorta happened.”
Then, the Owl Lady sighed. “But, and this is a big but, so pay
attention. If you want to just maintain the status quo with me as the
teacher and you as the apprentice, no mother-daughter stuff, I can live
with that.”</p>
<p>Luz paused, fidgeting back and forth on her tail. “I… uhm… I’m not
really sure what to say. Is it okay if I think about it for a bit?”</p>
<p>The Owl Lady nodded. “Sure thing ki- Luz. Take as much time as you
need. I know this is kind of a big deal.”</p>
<p>Luz shakily nodded her head. “Yeah, I agree.” Then, she wrapped Eda
in a hug. “Thank you, Eda.”</p>
<p>Eda reciprocated the gesture. “Aw, don’t worry about it. Whatever you
eventually decide on, I’ll respect that.”</p>
<p>Breaking from the hug, Luz jerked her thumb in the direction of the
stairs. “I think I’m gonna go stay in my room for a bit. Gotta think
about things.”</p>
<p>Eda smiled. “I’ll be down here waiting with bated breath.” She
ruffled Luz’s hair. “Now scram, I’ve got some crying to do.”</p>
<p>Luz chuckled. “Aww, you big softie.”</p>
<p>Eda gently shoved Luz towards the stairs. “Don’t you have some life
contemplating to do or whatever? Shoo.”</p>
<p>Taking her sweet time, Luz slowly climbed the stairs and entered her
room. Laying down on her bed, she stared up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>So, Eda thought of her as a daughter. Huh. Interesting. It wasn’t
like Luz was against the idea in a vacuum, but she had a few
reservations. First and foremost, what would Mama think if Luz showed up
back home and started talking about how she picked up a second mom? How
would she react? Luz wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>Then, of course, how would having two moms impact Luz herself? Who
would she stay with? Would she spend half of her time on the Isles and
half on Earth? How would she even differentiate them? Would she call
Camila “Earth Mom” and Eda “Isles Mom” or something? Nah that one wasn’t
it. Mama and Mom, maybe? Willow referred to her dads as Dad and Poppa,
so it wasn’t exactly a crazy idea.</p>
<p>Groaning, Luz rubbed at her forehead, trying to massage her brain
into working more clearly. A billion thoughts were swirling around in
her mind and it was confusing the basilisk.</p>
<p>A knock at the door pulled Luz out of her funk. Poking his head in,
King revealed himself as the visitor. “Can I come in?”</p>
<p>Sitting up, Luz patted the spot on the bed next to her. “Yeah, sure.
Hop up.”</p>
<p>Fully entering the room, King leapt onto the bed. Fluffing up the
blanket with his claws, the King of Demons made himself comfortable.</p>
<p>“Hey, do that on your own bed,” Luz ribbed, tickling King’s side.</p>
<p>“I am,” he tried to maintain his composure while Luz tickled him. “I
am the K- Stop that! - King of Demons, so your bed falls under my
domain.”</p>
<p>Luz made an exaggerated show of her thinking. “Hmm… Fine I’ll
stop.”</p>
<p>As King composed himself, Luz smiled. “So, what do you wanna talk
about?”</p>
<p>“Revenge,” King said pointedly.</p>
<p>“Revenge on… who exactly?” Luz wasn’t following.</p>
<p>“Amity, duh,” King said, like it was the most obvious thing in the
history of obviousness. “She set your brain on fire, so we need to get
back at her. We should… replace all of her Abomination goop with mud so
that she fails her classes. And - and burn all of her homework! And
trash her locker for good measure!”</p>
<p>Luz laid a hand on King to calm him down. “King, buddy, we’re not
getting revenge on Amity.”</p>
<p>“What? But we’ve gotta! We have to make sure she doesn’t mess with
you ever again,” King said.</p>
<p>“She never messed with me in the first place,” Luz replied. “Well,
there was when she tried to get me dissected when I posed as Willow’s
abomination, but that doesn’t count.”</p>
<p>“But she burned up all your memories!” King threw his arms out for
emphasis.</p>
<p>Luz sighed. “That was just a stupid mistake she made. Amity’s my
friend, King, just like you are. Would you try to get revenge on me if I
accidentally ripped a hole in François and then sewed him up right
after?”</p>
<p>“No,” King replied softly.</p>
<p>“My point stands. We aren’t getting revenge on Amity,” Luz said.
Then, she wrapped King in a side hug. “Eda told me that she had some
crying to do. Is she actually crying?”</p>
<p>King nodded. “Really hard. Pretty sure she’s eating some ice scream
as a coping mechanism.”</p>
<p>Luz chuckled. “I thought she was joking. I think we should give her
some time by herself. Say, King. Have you ever played a game called
Hangman?”</p>
<p>King lit up upon hearing the name of the game. “Ooh, is it about
executing people? I already love it! Do you have to design a knot for
maximum neck snapage, or is it more about how excruciating and painful
you can make it? I need to know!”</p>
<p>Luz frowned. “You concern me sometimes, King. You really do.”</p>
