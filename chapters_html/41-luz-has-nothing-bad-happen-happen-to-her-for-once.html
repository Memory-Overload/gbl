id="luz-has-nothing-bad-happen-happen-to-her-for-once">Luz Has Nothing
Bad Happen Happen To Her For Once</h1>
<p><strong>Kriegstag 4, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Luz cautiously peeked her head around the corner of the stairs. Yup,
Eda was true to her word. There, on the couch, the Owl Lady was busy
shoveling ice scream into her face.</p>
<p>“Eda? Are we okay to come down?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>Stopping mid-bite, Eda dumped the spoon into the pint of dessert and
placed it on the coffee table in front of her. “I’m ready as I’ll ever
be.”</p>
<p>Luz descended the rest of the way down the stairs and entered into
the living room. As she got closer to the Owl Lady, she shifted over on
the couch so that Luz could sit down and chat.</p>
<p>After a few seconds of awkward silence, Eda took initiative and
started talking. “Titan, I never thought I would be having a talk like
this. But I guess we’ve gotta do it.”</p>
<p>Luz slowly nodded. “Yeah, I think that’s for the best. So… should we
give it a test run?”</p>
<p>“We can try,” Eda replied slowly. She then got to her feet and dusted
off her dress. Clearing her throat, she stuck out her hand as if she was
meeting Luz for the very first time. “Nice to meet ya, Luz. I’m your
mom, Eda.”</p>
<p>Luz met the handshake. “Hi, Eda. I’m Luz, your… your…”</p>
<p>The basilisk froze up, which Eda frowned at. “Are you okay, Luz?”</p>
<p>Luz’s mouth felt dry. “I’m… not sure. Like, I feel like if I finish
that sentence then I’ll be… replacing my mom, err, Camila, with
you.”</p>
<p>Eda slowly retracted her hand and sat back down on the couch,
plopping down next to Luz “Look, Luz,” Eda started. “I know this might
be scary or daunting or whatever, but I want you to know that I truly do
care about you like a mother. You get that, right?”</p>
<p>Luz quietly nodded. “I do.”</p>
<p>“And, well, I’ve been thinking about your friends,” Eda continued.
“Willow specifically. She’s got two dads, yeah? Well, if you say that
you’re afraid of me ‘replacing’ Camila, then I don’t want to do that.
What if instead of ‘replacing’ your mom, I can be your… second mom or
whatever? Camila gets to be your mom, and I get to be your mom, and
neither of us replaces the other. We both co-exist as your mom<em>s</em>
plural. What do you think of that?”</p>
<p>Luz thought about it. Then she thought about it some more. Finally,
she came to a decision. “I… I think I like that idea. Is it okay if I
still call you Eda, though?”</p>
<p>“You can call me whatever you want, kid,” Eda replied with a smile.
Reaching over to the coffee table, Eda scooped up a pint of ice scream
that was half eaten and currently melting. “I think I’ve had enough
mushy feelings for today, though, so I’m done with that kinda stuff for
today. You wanna steal some of my emotional support ice scream?”</p>
<p>Luz giggled and grabbed the spoon that Eda offered out. “Yeah, I’ll
steal it.”</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Zorntag 4, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Hexside School
of Magic and Demonics</strong></p>
<p>As Luz hopped off Owlbert and gave Eda a goodbye hug, the basilisk
turned to face the school. She was looking for a certain set of familiar
faces. She easily spotted Willow and Gus near the steps, but Amity was
nowhere to be seen. Jogging over to her friends, Luz greeted them.</p>
<p>“Hey, guys!” Luz adjusted her backpack so it was more snug on her
shoulders. “So, did I miss anything wild while Bump had me
sidelined?”</p>
<p>Gus was the first to answer. “Eh, not really. Just the same old, same
old.”</p>
<p>”Well, except for all of the Grom posters going up,” Willow
added.</p>
<p>“Grom? What’s that? It sounds fun.” Luz was unfamiliar with the name,
but since people were apparently putting up posters for it, it had to be
some big event. Was it a carnival? A big game? A <em>dance</em>? She had
to know.</p>
<p>“Grom is a celebration that Bump puts on every year,” Willow
explained. “There’s dancing, snacks, a live band, fun things like
that.”</p>
<p>Luz gasped. “It’s a dance?!”</p>
<p>Willow shrugged. “Kinda? The dance part isn’t the main event, though.
That honor would go to when the year’s Grom Royalty enters the arena and
fights Grometheus.”</p>
<p>Luz raised her hand. “Quick question: what’s a Grometheus?”</p>
<p>“Grometheus is the name of a monster that lives under the school,”
Gus answered. “It uses a mix of Oracle and Illusion magic to transform
itself into the fears of whoever it’s fighting against. If we don’t
defeat it, though, then it will go on to terrorize the whole Isles and
make everyone suffer their worst nightmares until the end of time.
Nothing too bad, really.”</p>
<p>Luz’s mouth hung open. She couldn’t believe it. Principal Bump was
going to have a student fight against a literal fear monster?! “And this
is allowed… how, exactly?”</p>
<p>“I dunno, actually,” Willow said. “I’m pretty sure the
Parent-Creature Association strong-armed Bump into mandating it.”</p>
<p>Then, a question that Luz had been wondering finally got put into
words. “So how does Grom Royalty get named? Back on Earth there would be
a vote between a few popular guys and girls to see who was Prom King and
Queen. Is it the same ‘popular rich kid wins by default’ thing
here?”</p>
<p>“Thankfully, no. Grom Royalty gets hand picked by Bump,” Gus
answered. “He always ends up choosing a top student from one of the
tracks, though, so sometimes kids will intentionally bomb an exam or
assignment near Grom so they don’t have the chance of getting
picked.”</p>
<p>“Wait. Isn’t Amity the top student of the Abomination track? Doesn’t
that mean she could get picked?” Luz worried about her friend’s safety
if that was to happen.</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, but she’s a strong witch. She could probably beat Grom
with one arm tied behind her back,” Willow said.</p>
<p>Luz wasn’t going to argue with that. “Where is Amity, anyways?
Haven’t seen her yet.”</p>
<p>“We were just ta—” Gus started to say, but Willow quickly elbowed him
in the side to get him to shut up.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen her either,” the plant witch said. “She probably
just wanted to get to class extra early.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Okay then!” Luz said cheerfully. Amity was always studious, and
the basilisk thought that was admirable. (And there were some other
qualities about her that Luz liked, like her smile and the way she
laughed and how she was always so confident in herself and a lot of
other things that were cute.)</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bell tolled, signifying that classes were about to begin.
“Welp, I’ve gotta head to class. Bye, guys!”</p>
<p>Luz tickled her locker so that Juanito (the name she had settled on
for him) would spit out her Beast Keeping textbook. Her locker was
apparently in an extra good mood today, as he didn’t even spit her book
at her like a projectile weapon. Instead, he lolled his tongue out with
the textbook sitting on it.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Luz said quickly as she grabbed her book. Giving him a
goodbye scratch on the place where his chin would be, Luz took a deep
breath.</p>
<p>Today she was going to try to get back into the school groove after
missing the entirety of yesterday. The basilisk had wanted to not miss a
day if she had any say in the matter, but Bump had stood firm and forced
her to stay home for “her own safety.” That was a load of hogwash if
she’d ever heard it. She was totally fine!</p>
<p>As she headed to Beastly Biology, Luz just hoped that she hadn’t
missed something super cool. Or a pop quiz. While her grades were pretty
good - she was rocking a mid-to-high 80s in all of her classes - if she
had missed a pop quiz or some big event then that would have been really
unfortunate. Entering into the classroom, Luz took her normal seat
beside Viney near the middle of the classroom. The middle of the room
was the perfect spot for Luz to sit. She was far enough away that she
wouldn’t like a tryhard or some kind of teacher’s pet, but she was also
still close enough that Ms. Nascimento would still call on her when she
raised her hand.</p>
<p>Once Luz settled into her chair, Viney leaned over. “Where were you
yesterday? I had to do the live testing portion of Demon Wrangling all
by myself. Lemme tell you, trying to corral an angry snorse is
<em>not</em> fun. Pretty sure Wildfire bit me like ten times while
trying to get her reigns on.”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t you have found another person to be your partner?” Luz
asked.</p>
<p>“Do you really think that anyone would willingly partner with a crazy
witch like me?” Viney said flatly.</p>
<p>“Right, stupid of me to ask,” Luz replied. “But to, uh, answer your
question. I missed everything after lunch because my brain was… on…
fire.”</p>
<p>Viney took on a quizzical look. “What do you mean your brain was ‘on
fire’?”</p>
<p>“Well, I had photo class with Mrs. Daguerre,” Luz explained, “and we
extracted some memory photos from my brain, but then somebody set a few
of them on fire. We got everything sorted out, though, so I’m fine and
dandy and ready for candy.”</p>
<p>Viney didn’t look like she was convinced. “Huh, okay. You’re still
good to do class stuff, right?”</p>
<p>“Yup, I’m totally good,” Luz replied quickly.</p>
<p>“Well, if you feel like your brain is on fire, just lemme know.”
Viney said.</p>
<p>“Understood.” Luz nodded.</p>
<p>As Ms. Nascimento’s lesson started up, the two friends began their
typical idle banter, Luz’s brain mishap being the last thing on their
minds.</p>
<hr />
<p>For her next class of the day, Luz had Potions with Mrs. Lulamoon.
After navigating her way to the classroom, the basilisk settled down in
her usual spot next to Barcus. Since Luz was one of the few students who
could actually understand the canid-like demon, she acted as his
unofficial translator. Scrounging around in her backpack, Luz pulled out
her recipe book.</p>
<p>As Luz got ready for her first class of the day, Mrs. Lulamoon slowly
shuffled into the room. Soot and ash covered her face, and numerous
holes burnt into her clothing. Walking over to her desk, she collapsed
into her chair.</p>
<p>“Are you –” a student began to ask, but the teacher cut him off.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Lulamoon does not want to talk about it,” she said before he
had even finished his question. “Give her a minute.”</p>
<p>Summoning a cup of coffee, Mrs. Lulamoon down the entire mug in one
gulp before wiping at her mouth with her sleeve.</p>
<p>“There. Mrs. Lulamoon feels better. Now, for today’s lesson we’re
going to…” she squinted as she looked at the lesson plan written down.
She then scoffed and crumpled the lesson plan into a ball and threw it
into the trash can. “Today we were going to brew a potion of power, but
those things don’t work in the slightest so there’s been a change of
plans. What we are actually going to brew today is a potion of
rejuvenation. If you open your recipe books to page… 314 or so, you’ll
find the instructions and necessary ingredients.”</p>
<p>After trying to find the recipe, Luz noticed something was off.
Raising her hand, she let the teacher know about the mistake. “There
isn’t a page 314 in our book, Mrs. Lulamoon.”</p>
<p>“What?” she replied.</p>
<p>“Hate to admit it, but Noceda is right,” Boscha added. “Our recipe
book only goes up to 240 pages.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lulamoon grumbled in annoyance. “Ugh. I must have been thinking
about the book from last semester before they replaced it with a new
‘better’ version. I’ll just give you the instructions myself.” Getting
up out of her chair, she slowly walked over to the chalkboard and
started writing out everything the students would need and what they
would have to do to brew the potion.</p>
<p>As the list of steps required to make the potion grew, so did Luz’s
anxiety about messing something up along the way. Like, was she
seriously expected to somehow do exactly 3 and 5/8 stirs when combining
the ratworm bile with crushed bitterroot seeds? Luz had signed up for
this track, though, and she was a fool if she was going to let something
like having to follow incredibly precise instructions get in her
way.</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Lulamoon returned to her desk, she had another thing she
wanted to say to the class. “Fair warning, if you mess up any of the
steps after mixing the ratwork bile and the bitterroot seeds, you’ll
probably cause a massive explosion that could kill us all. Good
luck!”</p>
<p>Letting out a long exhale, Luz looked over at Barcus. “We’re not
gonna blow up, right?”</p>
<p>Barcus gave a yip of approval. <strong><em>&lt;We’ll be
fine.&gt;</em></strong></p>
<p>Luz began to slowly, carefully, measure out all of the ingredients
she was going to need for this potion. “Yeah, let’s hope. I don’t want
to go to the infirmary again.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Thankfully, Mrs. Lulamoon’s class was explosion free, which was
surprising to Luz. She could usually bet on at least one student leaving
without eyebrows or singing their hair, but today was a pleasant
surprise. As she walked through the halls, Luz spotted a familiar face.
“Hey Jerbo!”</p>
<p>The lanky teen looked surprised at someone having called his name,
but he relaxed after realizing that it was just Luz. “What’s up?”</p>
<p>“I know this may sound like a weird question,” Luz began, causing
Jerbo to raise an eyebrow, “but has Amity been acting… odd in the
classes you have with her?”</p>
<p>“I guess you could say that,” Jerbo replied. “She’s definitely been…
distracted. Yeah, distracted’s a good word for it. She’s not as quick to
respond to Professor Hermonculus asking her questions, and I’m pretty
sure I’ve caught her daydreaming or something in the middle of
class.”</p>
<p>“Huh,” Luz responded. “That’s certainly somethin’. Well, thanks for
the help!”</p>
<p>Jerbo brushed it off. “Any time. Say, are you still down to help us
put up flyers over the weekend?”</p>
<p>Luz nodded. “Uh huh. The whole school is going to be covered top to
bottom with posters talking all about how awesome multi-tracking
is.”</p>
<p>Jerbo nodded. “Alright. See ya then!”</p>
<p>“You know it!” Luz said as she walked off to her next class.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of navigating the halls, Luz arrived at Beastly
Biology with Mr. Medner. Unfortunately, Luz didn’t have any of her
buddies in this class. It was still an interesting one, though, so there
was something to look forward to at least. Waving hello to the teacher,
Luz got a small wave back in response before Mr. Medner had to return to
prepping his lecture. Plopping down in her usual spot, Luz pulled out
her pencil and notebooks, ready to start taking notes. From what Luz
could see on the teacher’s desk, she spotted a lot of different types of
bones. Hmmm…. That was intriguing.</p>
<p>Sitting up in her chair, Luz watched as Mr. Medner finally started
his lesson. Grabbing some chalk, the wizened witch sketched out
cross-sections of numerous bones, similar to the ones that sat on his
desk. The drawings were quite detailed, showing all the different
sections of the bones’ structural composition. Once he finished his
drawings, he turned to the class.</p>
<p>“Let’s see how many of you actually did your readings. Which of these
three bones belongs to a witch?” Medner slowly looked left to right,
seeing if any of his students was brave enough to answer.</p>
<p>Luz slowly raised her hand. She didn’t get the chance to do the
reading since she didn’t know the reading existed given that it was
assigned when her brain was <em>en fuego</em>, but she had a pretty good
idea what Medner was doing with this.</p>
<p>“Luz?” Medner said, looking in her direction.</p>
<p>“Is it none of them?” she responded, though she was unsure if she was
right.</p>
<p>“That’s correct.” Medner said with a smile. “Care to explain why that
is?”</p>
<p>“Well,” Luz took a breath. “I noticed that you left out the <em>caeli
maculae</em>. Since they aren’t present, then that indicates those are
all demon bones. Well, just not witch bones.”</p>
<p>Mr. Medner nodded. “You’ve a keen eye, Mrs. Noceda. Good job.With our
mini-pop quiz out of the way, let’s get started. Alongside the presence,
or lack thereof, of the <em>caeli maculae</em>, witch and demon bones
can be differentiated in a variety of ways…”</p>
<hr />
<p>Surprisingly, the rest of Luz’s school day was uneventful. Sure, some
of her teachers had questioned why she had been absent the day prior,
but that wasn’t anything a quick explanation couldn’t solve. As Eda
picked the basilisk up from the front steps, the witch asked her normal
slew of questions. “So, anything wild go down that I would’ve loved to
see?”</p>
<p>“Nope!” Luz replied. “It was pretty chill. I hope the rest of the
semester is, too.”</p>
<p>“I hope so, too, kiddo,” Eda said, leaning back and giving Luz a hair
ruffle. “I don’t think I can handle your brain getting torched
again.”</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Kaufetag 1, Seventh Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The
Bonesburrough Market</strong></p>
<p>Luz stretched the glove in her hand, making sure that it fit snug.
Tossing the baseball into the glove a few times, Luz was suddenly hit
with a wave of nostalgia. Back when Papi was still around, he would
always take Luz out to the local baseball diamond in Gravesfield and
they would practice hitting, fielding, even a little pitching. Of
course, Luz didn’t have the best hand-eye coordination way back when, so
her baseball skills weren’t exactly going to earn her any accolades.
Still, though, it was always a fun day when she and Papi could just go
out and spend a few hours messing around and having fun.</p>
<p>Now, though, Luz was hoping to have a similar experience with King.
Given, the market wasn’t exactly a good place to start swinging for home
runs, so playing catch would have to suffice.</p>
<p>“So, baseball is just throwing a ball back and forth? That’s kinda
boring,” King said. “Where’s the excitement, the guts, the
brawling?”</p>
<p>Luz scoffed and slowly shook her head. “Games don’t have to end in
someone dying, ya know? Catch is just a fun little thing people play.
There’s no points, no winners, no losers, just people enjoying the
moment.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm… I’ll try it.” King picked up another one of the gloves that
Owlbert had “found” (read: stolen from the trash). Slipping it on, he
waved his paw about. Thankfully, the glove remained on and didn’t go
flying off.</p>
<p>“Here, catch.” Luz gave the baseball a soft underhanded toss in
King’s direction.</p>
<p>The King of Demons moved his paw to snatch the ball, but it slipped
out of his glove when he didn’t close around it in time. The ball fell
to the ground and rolled in the dirt. Scrambling over, King picked the
ball up in his non-gloved paw. “Caught it!”</p>
<p>“Toss it over!” Luz said, waving her glove.</p>
<p>King complied, cocking his arm back and throwing the ball with as
much force as he could muster. Luz, for her part, swiftly snatched the
ball out of the air. “Good throw, buddy.”</p>
<p>The basilisk then gave a small laugh. “Next time you want to catch
it, try to squeeze the glove around it like this.” She then tossed the
ball straight up into the air before showing the technique that her
father had taught her all those years ago.</p>
<p>King nodded. “Got it. Lemme try again!”</p>
<p>“That’s the enthusiasm I like to see,” Luz said. She gave him another
underhand toss, though this time she put a little more speed on it.</p>
<p>This time, King actually caught the ball, scooping it up and holding
it tightly in his glove. When he realized that he’d actually maintained
his grip on the baseball, he let out a victorious “Yeah! I’m the best!”
and held up the ball like a trophy.</p>
<p>Luz couldn’t stop herself from smiling. Man, that felt good.</p>
<p>Suddenly, though, Luz felt something hot splash onto her face. Was
it… rain?</p>
<p>Eda let out a swear as she quickly packed up shop. “What good is
there in watching the weather report if the oracles are gonna get it
wrong. They said that it was gonna be clear skies all day.”</p>
<p>Luz had only experienced the boiling rains once before, and the last
time it happened, she’d learned her first glyph (and had to knock out
Eda while she was trapped in her Owl Beast form but that was secondary).
Hopefully something equally fun would happen this time around!</p>
<p>As the raindrops fell, Luz watched as all of the commotion and hubbub
around her died down while everyone sought out shelter.</p>
<p>“Come on, kid!” Eda yelled as she grabbed at Luz’s arm to pull her
onto Owlbert.</p>
<p>Luz resisted, though. Maybe it was her body just being late to
register what was undoubtedly intense pain, but she didn’t feel anything
when the drops of boiling water landed on her skin. In fact, it almost
felt kind of <em>nice</em>.</p>
<p>“Eda, I’m… fine,” Luz could barely believe what she was saying. This
was the Boiling Isles, and she was standing in the middle of the boiling
rain, and yet she felt like she was just taking a nice warm shower. Her
skin wasn’t melting off or anything!</p>
<p>“Eda?” King spoke up from his spot on Owlbert. “I, uhh, don’t think
the rain affects me, either.”</p>
<p>The Owl Lady turned to the tiny demon, a look of disbelief on her
face. “Are you two pulling some kind of prank on me?”</p>
<p>“Nope, no pranks!” Luz responded gleefully as she leapt feet first
into a big puddle.</p>
<p>“Well at least that means I only need the shield for me, then,” Eda
muttered to herself, rolling with the weirdness of her two kids
apparently being rain-proof. “Now come on, we gotta head home. You two
can do your little dance routine outside the house while I stay
inside.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” Luz said in an exaggerated manner, being sure to draw out the
“i”. Hopping onto Owlbert, she helped King up and let him ride on her
back.</p>
<p>The actual flight back to the house was thankfully uneventful. Luz
and King got to feel the raindrops against their skin and fur
respectively, while Eda maneuvered Owlbert to take the quickest flight
path back to the Owl House.</p>
<p>As Owlber touched down, Eda was quick to make the short trip back
into the house. Luz and King, however, stayed outside in the rain. It
wasn’t often that they were going to be able to experience something
like this, and they weren’t going to let the opportunity pass them
by.</p>
<p>Luz simply spread her arms out and spun around like she was some
movie actor. Running around, jumping onto rocks, doing her best to click
her heels in midair (she failed), she was having a blast. King was
similarly having fun messing around in the boiling rains. The small
demon was busy trying to get as messy as he could, rolling around in all
of the mud puddles that were forming.</p>
<p>As the rain picked up in intensity, the enjoyment for the two kids
playing outside only increased, and Luz was about to try something that
would either be super fun or super painful. “Hey, King!” she yelled,
hoping she was loud enough to be heard over the storm.</p>
<p>“What?” he shouted back.</p>
<p>“Watch this!” she replied.</p>
<p>The dirt path that connected the Owl House to the rest of
civilization had turned to mud, and Luz was ready to take advantage of
that fact. Running full steam ahead towards the impromptu mudslide, Luz
leapt into the air. While she was mid-flight, she quickly morphed into
her full basilisk form. Landing on the straightaway, the girl slid and
slid, screaming in joy all the way. When she neared the end of the path,
she tried to turn to slow down, but she only ended up causing a big
wipeout, tumbling end over end because of how slippery her underbelly
was. Finally coming to a stop in a patch of grass that hadn’t turned
fully into a sopping mess, Luz righted herself and raised her arms in
victory.</p>
<p>“WOOHOO!” she screamed before bursting into laughter.</p>
<p>King wasn’t going to let her have all the fun, though. Sprinting
forward on all fours, he approached the same mud patch that Luz had just
traveled down. Jumping into the air, he stuck his forepaws out in front
of him, while his hind paws were similarly spread out. As the King of
Having Fun landed in the makeshift mudslide, he aimed towards Luz.
Rocketing towards her, he couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p>“Catch me!” he shouted once he was about halfway down the path.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it! Luz replied, holding her arms out to catch the speeding
demon.</p>
<p>Apparently, though, King was going too fast for Luz to handle. As he
raced towards the end of the mudslide, he tried to do a small jump so
that he could land in Luz’s arms. When the basilisk tried to haul him
in, though, he ended up just knocking her over. As the both of them were
sent tumbling further down the path, neither could stop from
laughing.</p>
<p>As the two trudged back up the hill, Eda stuck her head out the front
door and yelled to get their attention. “Hey! Get in the house so I can
put up the shield!”</p>
<p>Sad that their fun had been cut short, Luz sighed and morphed back
into her human form. Thankfully, the mud that was previously stuck to
her underbelly slid off her while she changed shape, so at least she
didn’t have to try and wipe it off. King wasn’t as lucky, though, as his
fur was matted down and had large globs of mud and dirt and grass in it.
He was probably going to have to take a shower before doing anything
else, if just so that Eda wouldn’t be cross with him for getting the
floors dirty.</p>
<p>When Luz walked through the front door, Eda stopped her by sticking
her arm out. “Pick up the furball.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine!” King quickly replied. “I don’t need a shower!” He tried
to sneak under the two, but Luz scooped him up in her arms before he
could get past them.</p>
<p>Luz held him up so that she was looking him eye-to-eye. “Not so fast,
buckaroo.”</p>
<p>King frowned (Well, the closest he could get to a frown). “I don’t
want to do this.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and I don’t want to have to shower you by force,” Luz replied
with a flat expression. “You’re nearly as hard to clean as Hooty. Look,
buddy, we’re at a crossroads here. Either you willingly go take a
shower, or Eda and I force you.” Her voice then dropped to a whisper.
“And if I get to shower you then that means I might get to try out all
my fancy and <em>incredibly girly</em> shampoos on you.”</p>
<p>“No! Not the girly shampoos!” King squeezed himself out of Luz’s arms
and bolted up the stairs in record time.</p>
<p>When the two downstairs heard the bathroom door slam shut and the
water start running, Eda slowly shook her head and smiled. “Man, I
didn’t know you had that in you. Do you even have ‘girly shampoos’?”</p>
<p>“Nope,” Luz replied, popping the “p” emphatically. “I’m just glad he
didn’t call my bluff.”</p>
<p>“I guess I’m rubbing off on ya, aren’t I,” Eda said, ruffling Luz’s
hair in an affectionate manner. “Now don’t bother me because I’m going
to need to focus on dinner.”</p>
<p>“Okay!” Luz replied chipperly, giving the witch a nod of
acknowledgement. “Can I use the CB to call my buddies?”</p>
<p>“Sure thing,” Eda responded. “It’d distract me from cooking,
anyways.”</p>
<p>“Yeah!” Luz gave a cheer. After doing a celebratory happy dance, Luz
scooped the CB up in her arms and sprinted up to her room. Setting the
ball down on her desk, she made sure that everything was properly
oriented. She didn’t want to show up upside down on the call if the ball
had been flipped, after all.</p>
<p>Getting comfy in her bean bag that Eda had undoubtedly stolen from
the Human Realm, Luz swiped over to the video call app on the CB. Right
at the top of the list of contacts was “Best Friend Squad”, which was
the name that Gus had given the group of himself, Luz, Willow, and
Amity. Pressing the <em>Call</em> button, Luz just hoped that she
wouldn’t be interrupting anything important that her friends were
doing.</p>
<p>Amity was the first to respond to the invite. When the witch looked
up and saw Luz’s face looking back at her, though, she let out a yelp in
surprise and quickly left the call.</p>
<p>“Huh, that was weird,” Luz commented, thinking out loud.</p>
<p>Gus was the second person to join the call, accepting the invite not
even 10 seconds after Amity had made her sudden exit. As the
Illusionist’s face filled up the screen, Luz waved to the witch.
“Hey!”</p>
<p>In response, Gus smiled. “Hi. So, what’s up?”</p>
<p>Luz wavered her hand in a “so-so” motion. “Ehh, not much. Just
looking to kill time while Eda makes dinner.”</p>
<p>“Ahhh, okay,” Gus replied. “Any idea what Eda’s making?”</p>
<p>“Not a clue, Augustabeth,” the basilisk said. “I’m just hoping it’s
not something where I actually have to fight the food. Fairy night isn’t
exactly fun.”</p>
<p>Gus sucked in a breath. “Yeah, fairies aren’t exactly an easy meal.”
He paused before continuing. “Oh, just had a thought.”</p>
<p>“Oh, what’s your thought?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>The illusionist held up a stack of papers, but the video quality
wasn’t great, so Luz couldn’t make out what was on them. “Okay, so I was
doing some research on human’s earlier, and I wanted to run it by you to
see if the stuff I was reading was actually telling the truth.”</p>
<p>“That sounds fun,” Luz said, leaning forward in her bean bag so she
could see Gus’ papers better. “Hit me with your human facts.”</p>
<p>Before Gus could start, though, another person joined the call. Luz
watched as Gus’s box shifted over, and Willow’s face filled the right
half of the screen.</p>
<p>“Wazzzuuuppp?” Luz said, comically slurring a normal “What’s up?” and
drawing out the greeting.</p>
<p>“What?” Willow asked, a confused look on her face.</p>
<p>Luz’s mouth fell open. “You don’t know Wazzzuuuppp? That’s sad.”</p>
<p>Willow frowned. “I… don’t get it.”</p>
<p>Luz sighed and slowly shook her head. “Kids these days don’t
appreciate classic marketing campaigns.”</p>
<p>“We’re the same age,” Willow said.</p>
<p>“Shhh,” Luz held up her index finger to shush the witch, “I’m doing a
bit.”</p>
<p>“I still don’t get it,” Willow commented.</p>
<p>“I thought Wazzzuuuppp would have transcended dimensional barriers.”
Luz let out an exaggerated sigh. “I guess I was wrong.”</p>
<p>“So are you going to fact check my human research?” Gus inquired,
shaking his notes.</p>
<p>“Oh, right, sorry.” Luz said quickly. “Gimme yo facts.”</p>
<p>Gus tapped the papers against his desk to straighten them out. Then,
he began reading off the supposed human facts. “Alright. Is it true that
humans have been to their moon?”</p>
<p>“Yup,” Luz confirmed. “The first time we did that was back in… uh…
1968, I think? History was never my strong suit.”</p>
<p>Gus smiled and drew a check next to that Certified Human Fact. “Ok,
follow up: when was 1968? Like, I don’t know when that is in comparison
to the calendar system on the Isles.”</p>
<p>Luz stuck her tongue out as she did the mental math. “1968 was… 52
years ago.”</p>
<p>Gus looked amazed. “Humans have been living on their moon for over 50
years?!”</p>
<p>After Luz took a second to comprehend what Gus had said, she
responded with a clarification. “No. Humans don’t live on the moon.
We’ve only ever visited it like… 6 times or something.”</p>
<p>Willow was the next to comment. “Gus, that doesn’t even make sense.
Don’t you think Eda would have something from the human moon if there
were actually people living there?”</p>
<p>“I don’t exactly follow that logic, Willow, but thanks for backing me
up,” Luz said.</p>
<p>Willow smiled. “Like, I’m just saying. If humans <em>were</em> living
on their moon, then there would have to be commemorative merchandise.
Something like those shirts that Eda sells from time to time. You know,
the ones that say ‘I went to Salem and all I got was burned at the
stake’ or whatever. There’d be a moon version of that.”</p>
<p>Luz tried to stifle her laughter by covering her mouth, but failed.
“Dang it, that got me. Now I’m thinking about Eda scavenging through
trash cans on the moon and just jumping around in low gravity with a
giant sack of goodies over her shoulder like a weird Santa.”</p>
<p>That caught Gus’ attention. “Ooh, who’s Santa?”</p>
<p>“Santa is…” Luz paused as she tried to figure out how to best explain
Jolly Old Saint Nick. “Santa is a fictional, <em>fictional</em>, man who
dresses in a fancy red-and-white suit and once a year he delivers toys
and gifts to all the kids who were good that year.”</p>
<p>“Huh,” was all Gus replied with. “Are you sure he isn’t real? What if
he is actually a witch using his magic to teleport all over the
place?”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure Santa isn’t real, Gus,” Luz said. “Nobody can live
off a diet of only milk and cookies. Believe me, I’ve tried.”</p>
<p>That earned a laugh from Willow. “That couldn’t have been healthy.
Like, at all. So, changing topics away from Santa, have you thought
about anyone you might want to invite to Grom?”</p>
<p>Luz let out an exasperated sigh. Crossing her arms, she rested her
chin in the little nook she’d created. “Not really. Last time there was
a dance at school back in the Human Realm, I made this big grand gesture
to ask out this girl that I really liked. She shot me down, though, and
said I was trying too hard. Even if I did have the courage to ask
somebody out, who would even say yes to the weird kid who can’t do magic
the ‘right’ way?”</p>
<p>“Well, I can think of somebody,” Willow said. She cleared her throat,
trying to alert Gus to her plan, but he didn’t seem to get the memo
based on the blank look on his face.</p>
<p>“Really? Who?” Luz grabbed the crystal ball and pulled it closer to
her. The fact that somebody could potentially like Luz enough to
actually want to be her date to <del>Prom</del> Grom was a miracle.</p>
<p>“Ohh, I don’t know,” Willow said coyly. “Maybe I’ll tell you, maybe
you’ll figure it out on your own.”</p>
<p>“Tell me!” Luz shook the crystal ball viciously. “Who?”</p>
<p>“Hmmm…” Willow tapped her chin with her index finger. “I won’t
say.”</p>
<p>“Oh come on. At least give me a hint!” Luz pleaded with the plant
witch.</p>
<p>Willow giggled. “Fine, you’ll get one hint. You talked with her
yesterday.”</p>
<p>Luz stared at the CB. Willow couldn’t be serious. <em>That</em> was
the hint she got?! “Wow, thanks Willow. That only narrows it down to
like 30 people.”</p>
<p>“That’s the only hint you’re getting,” the plant witch replied. “I
can’t just tell you outright. That’d ruin the fun!”</p>
<p>“You are devious, Willow Park. Devious.” Luz jabbed her finger at the
crystal ball for extra effect.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a shout from the kitchen drew Luz’s attention. “Dinner’s
ready!”</p>
<p>Luz took one last look at her friends’ faces. “Welp, I think that’s
my sign to log off. Bye, guys!”</p>
<p>“Bye!” the two witches replied in unison.</p>
<p>Dropping off the call, Luz Scooped up the CB and hurried down the
stairs. After placing the ball back on its normal stand, she walked back
into the kitchen. There, Eda and King were already situated with their
spaghetti and heatballs dished up and waiting, and there was a third
plate set out with food in front of Luz’s normal spot at the table.
Sliding into her seat, Luz put her napkin in her lap and grabbed her
fork and spoon.</p>
<p>Luz looked at the plate that Eda had set before her. Spaghetti and
heatballs was a common meal at the Owl House. Eda wasn’t exactly known
for long, intricate meals. The easier it was for her to throw together
in a pot, the better for the older witch. That didn’t mean it wasn’t
good, though, and Luz wasn’t one to turn down a yummy meal.</p>
<p>Grabbing her fork, Luz swirled the noodles around, making sure that
the sauce covered all of the noodles.</p>
<p>When a timer dinged, though, Luz looked up from her meal, spaghetti
strands hanging from her fork. “What’s that?”</p>
<p>“That,” Eda said as she got up from her chair and walked over to the
oven, “is the roast spider. I think they’ll add a nice crunch factor to
the food.”</p>
<p>“Roast… spider?” Luz questioned.</p>
<p>“Right, you grew up in the Human Realm,” Eda said as she deposited
the tray of spiders in the middle of the kitchen table. “Don’t worry,
kiddo. Since you’ve got a demonic heritage – well, half-demonic – you
should be able to digest these bad boys with no problems at all.”</p>
<p>Luz looked down nervously at the tray of cooked spiders. She wasn’t
exactly jumping for joy at the prospect. However, Eda had spent time
cooking these, and it would be rude to turn down the witch’s offer.</p>
<p>After slurping down the pasta that was still on her fork, Luz
hesitantly stabbed one of the spiders with the fork tines. When the
roast spider was sufficiently stuck on her fork, Luz pulled it down onto
her plate and used the side of her fork to cut the arthropod in two,
revealing the weird spider meat insides. Was it even meat? Luz wasn’t
sure, and it didn’t seem the place to ask.</p>
<p>Now with a more palatable spider chunk, Luz scooped it up and quickly
popped it in her mouth so that she couldn’t think twice about the
decision. As the spider hit her tongue, Luz was surprised by how it
tasted. It was actually good? The warm and chewy insides contrasted
nicely with the crispy exterior, and Luz found herself actually enjoying
the flavor.</p>
<p>Reaching out with her fork, Luz shoveled a few more spiders onto her
plate. After splitting those ones up into chunks, she then combined them
with her pasta, making sure to get a few of the spider chunks coated in
the magical sauce that Eda used. Twisting her fork round, Luz managed to
get spider, noodles, and sauce all in one bite, and it tasted like
heaven. (Luz was also pretty sure that she had just sprouted her tail
and it was now wagging back and forth behind her chair, but that could
be dealt with later.)</p>
<p>“This is so yummy!” Luz said after swallowing her bite.</p>
<p>“I’m glad ya like it, kid,” Eda said. “It’s the old Clawthorne family
recipe that I stole from my mom. Maybe I could teach it to you one
day.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, I think that’d be fun.” Luz smiled.</p>
<p>The next few minutes passed without much talking, the only sounds
being the scratches of cutlery on plates and the occasional sips from
beverages. Eventually, though, everyone had finished their meal and were
busy cleaning their plates and silverware. Luz was on drying duty
tonight, while King was doing the actual washing, and Eda was
responsible for putting everything back in its proper spot.</p>
<p>When everything had been cleaned, dried, and put away, the trio
retreated to the living room so that they could all relax and wind down
for the night. Flopping down onto the couch, Luz kicked her feet up on
the coffee table. “So, what are we going to watch tonight?”</p>
<p>“Well, I doubt either of you would want to watch <em>The Duchess
Approves</em>,” Eda replied. “So I was just thinking that we could just
throw on Sinsney channel or something like that.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, I wonder if they’ll be showing any bloodsports,” King said as
he perched himself on Luz’s shoulder. “I haven’t seen a chump getting
guillotined on the CB in awhile.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s not exactly age appropriate for a TV-Y channel, King,”
Luz said, looking up at the small demon. “Or at least, I think.”</p>
<p>“All right, well I’m too tired to think anymore, so we’re watching
Sinsney,” Eda said. Grabbing the CB remote, she punched in the channel
number. The little box that flicked up on screen said that the current
program was <em>Reptilia</em>. Luz had a vague recollection of watching
the show before. When was that? Oh, yeah! She had watched this back when
King and Eda had gone shopping at the Night Market or whatever and she
had ordered a pizza. That was a fun night.</p>
<p>Focusing back on the show, Luz snuggled close with Eda and King.
While Eda tried to play it off like she was indifferent, Luz knew she
was putting on a front. As the opening theme, Luz watched as Anna (a
witch) and Weed (a salamander) sunbathed on rocks, ran from evil
robot-looking things, and endeared themselves to the townsfolk with
wacky antics.</p>
<p>As the episode started, Luz found herself being sucked into the drama
of the plotline. Weed and his
friend/maybe-girlfriend/tertiary-partner-in-crime Hedera had somehow
spun up a full-blown civil war in the town of Rockville over which
generic hot witch from a show on Anna’s scroll was the better character.
Personally, Luz would have picked the emerald haired witch since she had
a way more compelling backstory. It wasn’t Luz’s fault that Amelia was
such a well written fictional character, even if she only got like three
lines of dialogue. (Plus Luz thought her character design was pretty,
but that was neither here nor there.)</p>
<p>Looking to her side, Luz saw that Eda was completely enraptured by
the show. “So much for a silly kids show, right?” Luz said with a small
laugh.</p>
<p>“Shush, you’re gonna make me miss something important,” Eda replied,
not even turning to look at Luz. The basilisk sharply exhaled in a sort
of half-laugh before she returned to watching the show as well.</p>
<p>As the hours ticked past, Luz felt herself slowly grow tired. Rising
from the couch, the basilisk stretched her arms to work some feeling
back into them. “I’m gonna head to bed. G’night!”</p>
<p>“Night, kiddo,” Eda replied. The Owl Lady then reached her arm and
pulled Luz into a hug. “Love ya, kiddo.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Luz was caught by surprise by the witch’s sudden embrace. “Love
ya too, Eda.”</p>
<p>Once Eda broke off the hug, Luz scampered up the stairs to her room.
Taking a deep breath, Luz morphed into a pair of comfy pajamas. Flicking
off the lights, she crawled into bed.</p>
<p><em>Today was a good day.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Willow Park slowly climbed the steps to the front door of Blight
Manor. She hadn’t been here in years. Both everything and nothing about
the house had changed. She could still vividly remember her and Amity
kicking around a Grudgball and accidentally breaking a window. Maybe
that was the moment that Odalia Blight had decided that Willow was to
never be seen around her daughter again. She would probably never know,
though. Regardless of her thoughts about Amity’s mom, that wasn’t who
Willow came here to see. After taking a deep breath, she balled her fist
and knocked.</p>
