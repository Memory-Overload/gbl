</header>
<p><strong>Gehetag 2, Seventh Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | Hexside School of Magic and</strong> <strong>Demonics</strong></p>
<p>Luz took a deep breath as she put her textbooks away in her locker. If she wanted to even have a chance of Amity saying yes, she would have to pull off everything perfectly. She only had one chance to pull this off, and if anything went even the slightest bit awry then it would all be for naught. Steeling herself, the basilisk closed her locker and headed off to the classroom that Willow and Gus had stationed themselves in.</p>
<p>“Are 100% sure that you’ll have enough bile?” Luz asked, looking in Gus’ direction.</p>
<p>The Illusionist shrugged. “It’ll only be what? 30 seconds max? Not to toot my own horn, but I can do that in my sleep.”</p>
<p>Luz gave a playful scoff. “Okay mister, you don’t have to brag about your grandioso.”</p>
<p>It was now or never. Taking one last breath to ready herself, Luz nodded. “Let’s do this.”</p>
<p>Nodding in kind, Willow exited the room, heading off to find a certain Abomination witch. While Willow was out searching for her “victim”, Luz and Gus got to work preparing their portions of the Gromposal. Reaching into her backpack, Luz pulled out two things: first was <em>The Good Witch Azura: Battle</em> <em>For The Welttree</em> with a very specific page bookmarked via a sticky note. Tossing the book over to Gus, the boy got to reading the frankly overly-detailed description of the scene. Next, Luz withdrew a sketch that she’d made of her personal adaptation of Azura. Sure, she was going to be taking a few creative liberties, but it was still easily recognizable as the Good Witch herself. Concentrating on her morph, Luz felt herself grow taller and her hair lengthen as it began to trail down her back. Those were just the ones she could feel, though. Keeping focused on the morph, Luz willed her hair to turn the signature Azura green.</p>
<p>Grabbing her phone and navigating to the camera app, she examined the changes. Everything looked pretty much perfect, physically wise. Now was the hard part, though: the outfit. Azura’s outfit had so many minute details that Luz had to get exactly right. From the trim pattern at the end of the cape to the shine of the gem inlaid into the hat, Luz had to match it all.</p>
<p>(Okay, well she didn’t have to 100% be a carbon copy according to what Eda had said when she ran the idea by the Owl Lady, but Luz was also too much of a perfectionist to let even the slightest blemish go unfixed.)</p>
<p>Slowly, Luz’s Hexside uniform shifted and changed just like her body had. The arm sleeves and leggings specifying her chosen magic tracks all turned to match the white-and-mauve color scheme, while her tunic melded into the sleeves so that it was a single piece of cloth. At the same time, her typical Hexside- approved sneakers morphed into the stylish boots Azura used to kick the butt of evil all across the universe. Finally, there was the piece de resistance: the hat. Reaching into her backpack yet again, Luz grabbed the old baseball cap that Eda had yoinked from the Human Realm. Placing the hat snug on her head, the basilisk completed the final changes of the morph from weird and nerdy Luz to the cool and awesome Azura.</p>
<p>Patting her hands against her cheeks, Luz remembered something. She had almost forgotten it in the rush to get ready: she needed to change her voice! The last time she had tried to impersonate a made up person, Bump had called her bluff in like 10 seconds, and Amity would probably be able to tell it was Luz even faster. Letting out a small “Dang it!”, Luz got to work on shifting her vocal cords so that she sounded more like the Azura from the movie.</p>
<p>(The first movie, specifically, since that was the objectively better and more accurate to the source material Azura adaptation. She was still salty that the movie studio wouldn’t pony up the big bucks to bring back the original actor for the second movie.)</p>
<p>As her vocal cords warped and changed, Luz was just making random noises, trying to get a good gauge of what she should change. Eventually, she settled on a voice that was a fair bit deeper than her own and was just a touch gravelly. That would be good enough for now.</p>
<p>Luz let out a slow breath. “Alright. I think I’m ready. You ready, Gustanamo?”</p>
<p>“Yup!” he replied. “This shouldn’t be too bad, all things considered. Not lots of moving parts, which is nice.”</p>
<p>“Well then, shall we get in our places?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll go hide in the corner,” Gus said.</p>
<p>“Hey, you’re the most important part, man,” Luz said, giving him a side hug. “You’re bringing this whole thing to life, so give yourself some credit.”</p>
<p>“I guess,” he said reluctantly. Looking down at his watch, he checked the time. “Willow and Amity will probably be here soon, so I need to hide. What’s the human saying? ‘Break an egg’?”</p>
<p>Luz laughed at the boy’s malapropism. “Break a <em>leg</em>, I think you mean.”</p>
<p>Gus gasped and leaned back, a look of disgust on his face. “Eww, what?! Why would you want someone to get hurt? How is that a good thing?”</p>
<p>“Actors are weird,” Luz simply replied. “And beyond that, uhh… I dunno why they say it, actually.” Shaking her head, she refocused on the task at hand. “Regardless, we need to get in position.”</p>
<p>Nodding, Gus hid himself behind a collection of cauldrons and started spinning up the illusion. Luz, for her part, just had to be out of direct eyesight of the door which wasn’t too hard to do, just taking a few steps to the side and posing herself to be all magical and graceful like how the real Azura would carry herself.</p>
<p>As the door to the classroom slowly opened, Luz said a silent prayer to whoever was listening that this would go off without a hitch.</p>
<hr />
<p>Amity was getting a little tired of following Willow through the maze that was Hexside’s hallways. The Plant witch had shown up out of nowhere and just grabbed her by the arm and told her to follow, and it wasn’t like Amity had a good reason to retaliate. Classes weren’t for another 20 minutes, and Amity could count on Professor Hermonculus to spend the first 10 minutes of class so busy degrading the students that he wouldn’t notice her absence, so that meant Amity had plenty of time for… whatever this was.</p>
<p>“Just one more turn and we’ll be there,” Willow said.</p>
<p>“Seriously, Willow, why are we going so out of the way?” Amity asked.</p>
<p>“You’ll see,” Willow stopped in front of a random door and smiled. “Head on in.”</p>
<p>Sighing and rolling her eyes, Amity slowly pushed the door open.</p>
<p>There was a lot of things that Amity was thinking this could have been. Maybe it was Willow trying to get back into Abominations and she wanted Amity to give her a few pointers. Maybe there was some grave world-ending danger on the loose and they needed to fight it off. There was a lot of possibilities going through Amity’s mind about what could be on the other side of the door.</p>
<p>Whatever they were, though, was nothing compared to what she actually saw. It was if someone had taken the Garden of Grand Reveals and brought it to life inside the classroom. Trees of all colors and varieties stood tall, reaching up into the sky, far beyond what should’ve been possible. Stumblebees flitted to and fro, pollinating the many flowers that sprouted from the earth below their feet. Amity could even hear the rapids of the Raging Red River far off in the distance.</p>
<p>Beyond all that, though, was one thing that caught Amity’s eye. Standing in the middle of the Garden was the Good Witch Azura, letting the gentle breeze flow through her hair and ruffle her cape in a scene that looked straight out of a storybook.</p>
<p>“Azura?!” Amity couldn’t believe her eyes at who stood before her.</p>
<p>“Greetings and salutations, traveler,” Azura said, turning to face the newcomer and bowing low.</p>
<p>“You’re… you’re real!” Amity was trying her best to hold back her excitement, but she was talking with freaking <em>Azura</em>!</p>
<p>“Yes, I do believe I am,” Azura said with a small smile.</p>
<p>“How -” Amity stumbled over her words. “How are you are here? Why are you here?”</p>
<p>Azura let out a sigh. “Well, it is quite a story, I must say. Would you be willing to listen?”</p>
<p>Amity nodded fervently. “Uh huh, yeah, tell me!” She answered maybe a tad too eagerly.</p>
<p>Azura nodded stoically. “It all started around a month ago. I was just about to finally defeat the nefarious Gildersnake and banish it for all eternity, when I felt an odd force. It was like I was being separated from reality. When I finally awoke, I was here in the Boiling Isles. I was originally going to try to return to my own reality as quick as I could, but something compelled me to stay here. To explore. And through that exploration, I’ve discovered something. While I’ve had enough adventures to last me a dozen lifetimes, this world offered me one even greater than all of my previous escapades combined.”</p>
<p>“Really, what is it?” Amity was on the edge of her proverbial seat.</p>
<p>“I’m not quite sure what I would call it,” Azura admitted. “But I think you would be a great companion for me on this adventure. I only have one question for you, though.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Azura stood up straight and removed her hat. Looking Amity in the eye, her face began to shift and change, her hair becoming shorter and darker, her eyes changing in a flash from green to golden brown. After what felt like an eternity, but was realistically only a few seconds, the face of Luz Noceda was looking back at her.</p>
<p>“Amity Blight, will you go to Grom with me?”</p>
<p>Amity fainted.</p>
<hr />
<p>Luz rushed to catch the falling Amity, scooping her up before there was unfortunate meeting between her face and the floor. Thinking quickly, the basilisk dragged the unconscious witch over to one of the desks that they’d moved over to the wall and sat Amity down in it.</p>
<p>Willow and Gus quickly joined Luz in checking up on their friend, but they were careful not to crowd her.</p>
<p>“Well… she didn’t say no?” Luz said with a shaky laugh.</p>
<p>Willow shot her a look. “I don’t think now is the best time to be making jokes.”</p>
<p>As quickly as she had passed out, though, Amity regained consciousness. The witch rubbed at her forehead as she slowly sat up. “Luz? Willow? Gus? What… What happened? How did I get here? I just had this crazy dream. It was - it was like I got transported into the Garden of Grand Reveals, and Azura was there… but then Azura turned into Luz? And then Luz-Azura… asked me out to Grom?”</p>
<p>Luz quickly looked to Willow and Gus for advice about what to do here. Willow made an “are you serious right now” gesture by bringing her palms together and pointing them at the basilisk. Gus just shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>Sucking it up, Luz gently placed a hand on Amity’s shoulder. “Amity, that wasn’t a dream.”</p>
<p>“Huh,” Amity replied oh so eloquently. “Wait… so you -”</p>
<p>“Morphed into Azura and had Gus conjure up an illusion of the Garden so I could ask you out to Grom,” Luz finished for her. “Yeah, yeah I did. I never got an actual answer from you, by the way.”</p>
<p>Amity slowly rose from the desk with a little help from Luz. “Wow. I mean… It’s just… <em>wow</em>.” She gave a small laugh. “And here I thought me wanting to ask you out to Grom would be the hardest part of my day. You beat me to the punch, Noceda.” The witch reached into her back pocket and withdrew a folded up note that was lavender in color. She quietly held out the note for Luz to take. “If you want your answer, then read this and I think you can make an educated guess.”</p>
<p>Luz grabbed the note from Amity and slowly unfolded it.</p>
<div class="gromNote">
<p>Luz,</p>
<p>will you go <br> to Grom with me?</p>
<center>
- Amity
</center>
</div>
<p>Luz looked down at the note, and then back up at its author. “I’d love to go to Grom with you, Amity.”</p>
<p>Amity let out a small laugh and sighed. “Phew, that makes me feel so much better. Well, I guess that means the next thing I have do is pick out an outfit for the big night.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’ll look stunning in whatever outfit you come up with,” Luz said.</p>
<p>“That’s easy for you to say,” Amity responded. “You can just shapeshift into whatever outfit you want at a moment’s notice.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I would just be using my natural abilities. Is that a crime or something?” Luz asked rhetorically.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you two aren’t already girlfriends ‘or something’?” Willow intoned.</p>
<p>Luz blew a raspberry in response, which drew a laugh from Amity.</p>
<p>“Hey, uh, hate to break up a touching moment, but we all have class in like 5 minutes,” Gus pointed out.</p>
<p>Luz let out an exaggerated groan. “Fiiiine, I guess we can go be good students.”</p>
<hr />
<p>For one certain basilisk, she was having trouble focusing on her classes. She could still barely believe that everything had gone so smoothly. (Well, except for the whole ‘Amity fainting’ thing, but that could be brushed under the rug.) She actually had a date to Grom! Like, for real and she wasn’t getting pranked!</p>
<p>“Miss Noceda?” A voice suddenly snapped her out of her trance.</p>
<p>Luz snapped to attention, but she still had no idea what she was being called on for. “Sorry, can you repeat the question?”</p>
<p>“When brewing Wyvern’s Breath, what is the ratio for spider venom and firebee honey?” Mr. Bonecrusher asked.</p>
<p>Luz paused as she thought back to the recipe book. “Uhh… Four ounces of venom for each ounce of honey?”</p>
<p>“Got the right numbers, but backwards. The ratio should be 4:1 in the other direction.” Bonecrusher corrected.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the bell screamed, indicating the end of the class. As Luz began to pack up her cauldron and backpack, she was stopped when Bonecrusher called on her again. “Miss Noceda, if you could stay for a minute after, please.”</p>
